So, yes, we graduate many, many students for the public schools.",Administrator,man
ID8,Campus Environment,"here are some students who get into the teacher education programs who have been underprepared based on the experiences that they have had in their previous public schools or private. Then there are other students who are included, transfer students, because they get a large transfer population, who come and seem to be a little bit more ready for the rigor, if you will",Administrator,man
ID8,Campus Environment,"If I were to describe Jackson State I would say Jackson State is one of the, well, among the top HBCU's that is striving to develop an image that will be appealing to people period. That's where we're going. We're interested in a global education. We've invested a lot of money in international programs here. We are technology infused. In fact, the former position that I had was just the Dean of Undergraduate Studies. Now with the emphasis on technology and everything that position was repurposed to be the Dean of Undergraduate Students and Cyber Learning. So if you were to visit our library you would see that it's no longer traditional as we know. The first floor is all about how you use technology to improve the teaching and learning process, all the way from innovate, that's an area that teachers can do stuff, create, students can do things and then the faculty development. So Jackson State is really a place now that is getting a whole lot hits about its whole technology infrastructure, its emphasis on engineering because we offer a degree all the way from bachelors to the doctorate. We are looking at the plant facility, the physical facility of this place, how important that is in terms of people making decisions about if I want to matriculate here or if I want my child to matriculate here, how you're concerned about where the kids are going to learn. If there is living and learning where they will learn. So Jackson State is headed in that direction. Last year our enrollment grew 4.5% and that's unusual in the state of Mississippi. So Jackson State has a part of its master plan to have the enrollment of 15,000 in three years, I believe. 
",Administrator,man
ID8,Campus Environment,"So I'm thinking that's what you would think. We are more community focused than we were say five years ago. Back to the outreach part, Jackson State has really, our leadership now believes that the community plays a real role in helping the university to realize its potential. So we have, like I said, that's our part in the school, Blackburn Laboratory Middle School, which is within walking distance. Then, of course, we have sites, we have downtown campus where we're housing the Institute of Covenant and some social work programs, the public service kind of thing. Then",Administrator,man
ID8,Campus Environment,I also think that mentioned how we have a large number of students in the STEM fields and those students are doing outstanding internships with the various agencies. I think you would mention the public service part which ties in with Blueprint for Mississippi.,Administrator,man
ID8,Challenges,"As you know, in Mississippi the schools are rated in terms of the students' performance on certain standardized measures. And based on how they perform on those assessments that school can be rated either high or low. One of the challenges for the public schools is keeping those ratings above where we can become recognized as a state who really, really prepares students because that's really what those ratings say to the greater community and to the greater work. So one of the challenges is how can the university or how can the College of Education carry this current pedagogy, instructional practices, use of technology in teaching and learning to where the problems are? And that's in the public schools to help them to retool or repurpose those teachers so that they can ensure and they can know when students have truly learned something. How can you move away from the public schools just giving this rote kind of memory kind of thing that has really no application for students and they progress up the ladder.",Administrator,man
ID8,Challenges,"Our challenge is how do we get more students who are in teacher education to be successful on these licensure assessments the first time around. That's a challenge that we see. The very first time how can we tie that in so closely with all the teacher ed courses that we are monitoring that as we go along. Do you see what I'm saying, so that students will not sit more than once, at least no more than twice for a test when you have taken the courses. I recognize and as I said earlier some of the students come in further behind than others. So I think there needs to be somewhere that can meld into what I'm doing in my coursework. So that's a challenge.",Administrator,man
ID8,Challenges,"Another thing, another challenge that we have is retaining faculty for the long haul. You may have faculty up there who have been there for the long haul but a lot of them are not in the teacher education area. So now one thing that has helped with that is we have a new chair in early childhood and elementary education who has come from one of our sister schools, Ole Miss, and are energetic, ready to bring what she learned from elsewhere or from preparation. So we hope to see a turnaround with that but that's a challenge that we have. So I'm not sitting here saying all our students are passing the test the first time they take it. I know they don't. They eventually do because you can't graduate unless you do.",Administrator,man
ID8,Challenges,Then the other challenge for some of the students who began the matriculation may move to a nonteaching field because I want to graduate. Surely this is not the first time you've hear it. I want to graduate. Then I may come back and take those courses and come to teaching like that. I prefer that you finish your program that you came for rather than just graduating. But that's one of the challenges that we see.,Administrator,man
ID8,Challenges,I think one of the biggest problems is taking that information that I have and answering the questions. That's what I think is one of the things. The other thing I think has to do with your preparation in mathematics. A lot of students take the last number of course in high school in math and they need to take the most. So I know math gets them sometimes and I also know doing that analytical thing.,Administrator,man
ID8,Challenges,"listening to the theories, the how you manage a class and then be able to take that and use it to answer those questions. That's one way. Then the other thing that I see is I don't think we teach the young kids but I don't think we teach the rules of grammar anymore, you know what I'm saying, the language anymore. I think it is expected that we just learn it through some other ways and those questions are on that test.",Administrator,man
ID8,Challenges,"I saw so many students that I taught in high school. They're grown and everything but this guy came to me and he said are you still having the students to conjugate the verb to be? You know I've never learned how to conjugate that verb. I said, no, I don't teach that anymore but he remembered. He said, yes, I remember. He really made me a better writer. I didn't do the to be verb but I did some of the other verbs. I thought that was interesting because that had to have been 25 years ago. So that was interesting. But back to what you were saying, I think those are some of the problems. You must know how the language is put together and you must be able to know what is the overarching thought here and you must be able to pick out that that has nothing to do with that. So aligning the curriculum with the things that they must have may be one of the problems. The Praxis probably won't set in but they may be one of the problems.",Administrator,man

The demand to get in is exceeding our supply of classrooms, faculty, and all of that, because on the retrenchment side, to receive only 1% growth money each year is just token. It's not doing it. So for the past four years in particular, Fresno State has been denying fully CSU eligible students, denying. There's no space. So four years ago was like 2000 and 3000, 4000. So this coming fall '15, we estimate more than 5000 will be CSU eligible but denied, no space.",Administrator,man

So it's more difficult these days for first time Freshman to go directly from high school. I mean they get in. we still admit more than 3000. This past fall was 3500, and that was like a high mark. But we can't do 3500 again this next fall. We got penalized for doing 3500. We had to pay back, so we were penalized money. We had to pay back because we went over enrollment. So we have to bring that now down to 3200, 3100, alright, but then each year the number of applications grows by several thousand.",Administrator,man

But those who are in the 3.0, 2.5, that marginal, community college, prep, get the preparation, knock down those remediation issues.

They went to visit me at home and asked my parents why don't you send Raul to school. My father in all of his wisdom just told them why don't you ask him. So they went to me and said why don't you go to school and I said what do you want me in school for? I don't want to go to school if I'm going to be sitting in the back of the room. I can do better than that. I can do better things with my time than sitting in the back of the room. I can go the fields and I can make some money to help my family. I don't need to waste my time going back to school like that. So then the recruiter asked me a critical question. What is it going to take for me to take you back to school? At the spur of the moment I said well give me a tutor and I'll go back. And he did. He gave me a tutor. So I said oh I guess what I wanted now. I've got no excuses.

I need you in my program.” “Why?” “I have about 42 students that need your help. So I want you to work for me.” I said, “I can't. I'm already teaching two classes and I'm in the master's degree program.” He said, “I don't care. You come to my office.” I said, “I can't work. I already have two classes.” He didn't give up.

You apply and I will admit you.” “Really? Okay, I'll give it a shot.” So I completed the application right there, turned my application in and right away he called me. Do an interview with this counselor and at the end I walk out and then he comes out to tell me that I was not recommended. That tears me up. He didn't recommend me for admission to the university because of my language challenge. That was his excuse. He said linguistically he is not ready. I was mad.

You made me do this application process just for you guys to tell me that I'm not admitted? I don't need this stuff.” He said, “Really? You were not recommended?” Yeah. So the secretary gives him the paper work and he says, “Come to my office.” So I went to his office. “Look what I'm going to do.” He puts ‘admitted.'

I think it works better for Natives if you use your story to teach because then they can always see. They're great at that circular story. I use my life basically to teach a lot of lessons or a lot of things. Of course that helps me too because then I can lay it out there and look too. That's one of the things.,Faculty,woman
ID2,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,"they allow us the freedom to decide exactly how we're going to implement that and then they provide us with whatever support that we needs. So here at Jackson State basically what we do, again, we have it set up where the initial year that they come in we work with the students. Again, we get them set up with mentors out in the schools. We also provide them with experiences to serve and working with young kids along with taking their courses. We utilize the cohort model. So each year we select five students and the cohort model is intentional. We want to bring in a small number so we can actually make sure that we're effective in what we're doing. So when we bring in the five, again, we work with them. We set it up where they can live together in housing and also I set up their schedules where all of them take their classes together or as many classes together as possible. So, again, they're going to matriculate through the program together and that way they can be that support system for them.",Faculty,woman
ID2,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,"At the end of their first year in the program we require that they go to Clemson for the summer for the Clemson internship. Again, we want them to have that experience where initially so they can really get a sense of what the program is about and spend time with graduates of the program and also the MISTER's from around the country so they can get that sense. After that initial summer we set it up where they get a choice now. So they can either go to Clemson or they can stay here in the state of Mississippi and we'll set them up with their own internship. So we've had MISTER's that have served at, in Cohort 1 they've done both. They've been to Clemson; they've stayed here in Jackson, Mississippi. Cohort 2, which is our sophomores right now, they've been to Clemson and then Cohort 3, which are our freshmen this year, they will be required to go to Clemson.",Faculty,woman
ID2,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,"Here we want to basically do the same thing. Our goal is that, yes, they have to put those four years in a Mississippi classroom. Yes, we want to keep them around. We want them to have the skillset to either stay in the classroom, become consultants, become administrators but stay in the field of education and hopefully stay here in the state of Mississippi so we can make a difference in our community right here. So, yes, teaching is at the center and the core of what we do and we want them to be able to advocate for the children. We're talking about minorities, male or female. We want them to be able to advocate for whomever ends up in their classrooms.",Faculty,woman
ID2,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,"M: Oh, I'm expecting them to be great teachers. I see a lot of potential. The good thing about the program is again the way it's structured. They get a lot of early field experiences. So by the time they begin their sophomore year they probably spend as much time in the field as our juniors here going through the traditional program. During the summers they spend probably 2 ½ months of full days in the classroom. It's not observation type work. They're either co-teaching or some of those in the upper class are teaching the classrooms themselves. So they're getting a ton of experience early on in the classroom.",Faculty,woman
ID2,Cohort Model,"Those classes, the teacher education classes were kind of mandatory. They worked all day and whatever and it was kind of like really pulling teeth to get them to kind of get through this. In my own classes like the drug and alcohol counseling I really run everybody through treatment and basically they're the counselor and they're a client. So they pair up. So it's more like a hands on and it's a cohort group because I have to teach everything one year. So whenever I'm teaching that year I have them all for every class and they go through it. Then the next year it's the same. They tend to help each other and work that way. So that's a good tool. We thought about cohort because the original teacher ed all those teachers are not retired or gone or whatever. They had a cohort group that they trained several teachers years ago. I think Helen might be one of them. I don't know if you're going to meet her or not. Helen Parker?",Faculty,woman
ID2,Community Service,"They're kids so whatever the community is going to support or want or acknowledge those kids are going to do. I mean if the community acknowledged education and said a school is important here let's make sure that's what we want for our children. The children would do it. They're kids. So basketball is everybody goes to the games. Everybody shows up. It's the community, the basketball is their heroes. They're the men of the hour kind of like",Faculty,woman
ID2,Cultural Relevance,"I came here, it's interesting. People think that reservation is so dysfunctional. But when I came here I had just over four or five years I had lost my father, two children and my husband. So I was kind of a wounded healer. But through teaching these kinds of classes and everybody listened. I told them I had the perfect job because I could talk and they had to listen. I actually was, we had a workshop one day and I was like oh I've been healed, I mean by the community because they listened. That's kind of how I got here.",Faculty,woman
ID2,Cultural Relevance,"So I think when you're trying to bring people of color to teach their own students because some people are just too white. Some people can cross the line but some cannot. It's kind of like if you want to work with another culture you have to become kind of marginal in your own culture so that you can connect to their culture. Some people are just, they just cannot move of front and center of their own culture. That's really part of the problem",Faculty,woman
ID2,Cultural Relevance,"F: Yes, challenges. Students, Native students are not white students. They are not, you know, all of education basically is geared towards European knowledge, whatever. Okay, so we're trying to fit Native people into this mold. Reality is like the poverty stuff. It really kind of hits a lot of it too. A lot of them come from poverty so they have that type of thinking, that type of mentality. School is middle class, saving, it's that work hard today and you'll get better and do better tomorrow. In their world it's more like in the moment or the humor, whatever. If they fall apart instead of just keep on trucking they will fall apart for two or three weeks or whatever and then suddenly come back and like oh I just want to start where I left off. So they don't have that strength, I guess.",Faculty,woman
ID2,Cultural Relevance,"I'm kind of teaching a new curriculum. We have the rural health certificate that's going to be geared towards Natives. The applied psych part of it I'm going to do like mindfulness training. We have a facilitator training class that's basically to teach peer counseling. We have three Native classes that were developed by actually she got a lot from Turtle Mountain for them to expand their teacher ed and do teacher ed and early childhood. So then there's three classes on kind of healing like how do you be Native. What does it mean? Some of them are really white, let's face it. The genocide is probably half way alive and well. Their spirits are not, they're gone, they've lost that because of the genocide. So it's up to them to bring it back and then they can decide whether they really want to be Native or white. But it's okay for them. The ones that make it learn like I could be Native in my own home and Native in my heart, Native in my spirit but I can utilize the Western money or the Western ways but they have to know that that's separate. It's just a kinder genocide really when they give handouts or all of this kind of stuff. It's just a simpler, kinder type of genocide. It's not really okay who are you, what do you stand for, how do you?",Faculty,woman
ID2,Cultural Relevance,"So we're trying to have this Native, rural Native degree as part of that kind of looking at the genocide, the trauma. I work with that age, the adverse childhood experience and we're trying to research some of that. Then research some of these classes this summer to see if that does heal. So really I'm more interested in healing and whether they know stuff. I can heal them they can go and do what they need to do. Of course I teach human services so I have the luxury of not being able to teach more from that perspective than okay here's this academic nose to the grindstone, here is what is expected of you in a European way. They joke about it. I'm kind of an odd teacher or whatever but that's really kind of what we're trying to do.",Faculty,woman
ID2,Cultural Relevance,"F: Like becoming a whole person. They call them the full body, basically they heal but that would be in your mind, your body, your spirit and your emotions are whole and you're walking in them. Then you can, whatever life, whatever you want to do but you're balanced. The Native people really originally and they've lost a lot of it. That's why I think they were feared because they interacted with nature as part of the whole. So they could do things. They worked with their mind. Actually we just had a lecture from Joseph -0:17:33- he's on a sabbatical at Bozeman and he came up and we had this research conference. Natives, the original natives were rather violet culture. They counted coup but they used that strength, that mastery, that mastery of more, that mastery of life and to utilize their mind and strength and all of their ceremonies and life with that mastery, that sense of whatever.",Faculty,woman
ID2,Cultural Relevance,"So if they can translate that mastery then into a ceremony and into their lives then they can remain because they can, Native is, I mean it's a personal way of being. It's not white. It's a way, it's a spirit, it's a way of being. It's not that they can't be successful in the material world but they have to understand that's separate and it's like okay as far as your spirit would be concerned this is what I have to do to feed my family or to survive or to make it or whatever. It doesn't matter what anybody looks like, what I look like if I'm scrambling in the dirt or whatever. Native culture is a survival culture. It's a tribal, a pretty basic survival level not glamorous, what history has made of it is not really what Native is, what being native is. They have to decide that for themselves. It's an individual thing. It's what everybody has to decide okay who is your, who are you, who is your spirit, who is your whatever. Then this is what I do over here. For Natives there isn't, for the tradition out there it's no separation between that spirit and that life. It's not go to church on Sunday and say you're sorry and everything works. What I look at it I don't even know if we kind of put this out there and how many of them would really choose to just pick up that Native spirit and be Native or do they want to be white or is there a choice.",Faculty,woman
ID2,Cultural Relevance,"they need that strength, that mastery, that idea that they need to because those that do it become usually very successful. They often because then the other, everybody looks at them and wonders where did you come from or they want what that person seems to have.",Faculty,woman
ID2,Cultural Relevance,"ou strip them of their will to scramble around and to stand up and to figure out, to pull it in and say okay this is who I am and this is my spot in the universe. You don't do that. You only do that when pain or something gets you, makes you move versus if it's kind of handed to you then oh well okay they want you to jump through this hoop and this is what I'm going to do to get this but the hoops are all white. Pretty much. That's called genocide. I mean it's just a kinder form of and I don't even know if they understand all of that or where that really comes from. I work with some pretty harsh people because I do different things too like Journey with a Drum or different kinds of things. That kind of knowledge is a little bit different that your European, than your education. Natives if they want to truly be Native it's not the easiest life. It's a really strong mastery, a really strong life. Heaven knows they have enough dysfunction that they should be able to use to pick that up but the handouts don't really or we have this tribal government scandal or whatever. That greed that's not me. That's kind of basically from European materialistic point of view.",Faculty,woman

I teach human services and I break that up basically into one year I teach a drug and alcohol counseling disciple. We just started doing our rural health degree here towards community health. So basically that's kind of what I've done. I know I'm here because I used to teach, we had a grant that worked with Head State people and part of their reason to be hired was that they have to pick up their continuing education. So they couldn't find anybody so I would teach on like Friday, Saturday and Sunday. I would teach weekends and teach these classes or try to teach evenings to these women that had worked and then came to school. Some of them made it. It was really hard for them to get their generals because we scheduled their core classes around their work. But I see this year there's say three or four that are coming, that I remember having in their core classes and they're coming back now picking up their education, their generals. Two of them are really going to finally get a two year degree from having started way back when we had this grant.",Faculty,woman

I mean those are the role models that kids see. They don't see in the classroom and there's been some excellent teachers over there that are white that did care.

ID3,Campus Environment,"Like you were an alien? I would say Stone Child College has a mission and our mission is very unique because we are Native. We have our Native backgrounds and so then we try to perpetuate, maintain whatever else wording you want, for our languages, which is Chippewa and Cree. Mostly everything is Cree. There are some Chippewa things happening but not as much as the Mother, I think it's more Mother language, the history, the language history, culture. It's all embedded in there. So I think most everything we do we try to keep it going on top of access and the community. We have our core teams, culture, community, that we try to come across with. We do have some guiding principles. Those include assessing and make sure that we're in compliance with everyone and especially Northwest because if it weren't for them we would not be and so we need to make sure.

Some don't talk to just anybody. My job is a thankless job but I like it. It's okay because I have an education background that says I need to keep going. I hardly see the students but I do the surveying at the end of their time with us.

We have multiple choice and things of that nature. But we need to I think if they can critically think about it and they can take the knowledge that they know and relate it, transfer it to that I think they will be able to handle it. But I'm thinking that, say for example, learning theories. They know the theories but when you get to the test they don't ask you, they don't say -0:05:14- but they might have something about constructivism.",Faculty,man
ID7,Challenges,you learned that particular concept in eighth grade. And so now when you take the math or the reading or the writing you see all these things coming up that you didn't cover years ago.,Faculty,man
ID7,Challenges,"First of all I would say everything even, you know, it's aligned with the Common Core Standards as well. So if you were just introducing the Common Core Standards to your students at a lower grade level then you're expecting for those students to develop that skillset. They get it in third, fourth, fifth or sixth grade. But now you're still getting it. You haven't had it. This group of students who have not had, they have not had the Common Core Standards. But the test is aligned up with the Common Core Standards.",Faculty,man
ID7,Challenges,"I think also that when you design a test I think it should not be so, should I say, I can't think of the word for it, centered around what's going on now. I say that because ten years from now they're going to say oh that doesn't work. We're going to remove cursive in third grade. You're aware of that. So they're going to discover ten years ago, ten years from now that we shouldn't have. We should bring back cursive writing. So I'm thinking they're building the test around the now rather than building a test, creating a test that will, is longstanding, the basic skills that you will always need those skills rather than the skills that you need to know right now.",Faculty,man
ID7,Challenges,"So what we do, what we find ourselves in HBCU's we find ourselves having to teach some skills that our students don't know.",Faculty,man
ID7,Challenges,And you have to talk about that. You have to actually do a dry run. I had Abigail in my class and Abigail works with me. She developed a workshop and she actually walked through that process. How do you create a thesis statement? What are you looking for? What are some questions? When you talk about supporting details what are you talking about?,Faculty,man
ID7,Challenges,"Yes, they do. And you know what, we might start off with 300 education majors and you know what at the end of the day we might graduate 20. What has happened is the students graduate but they don't graduate in education. They graduate in early childhood and licensure programs. They graduate in interdisciplinary programs. But the goal for them is to graduate with a degree and many times they take that test over and over and over and over again. And when do you tell them or do you tell them or do you tell them you might need to rethink this now? Or do you just let them make ETS and Pearson rich by spending $85 here? I find and what I've discovered is that many of the students they have the desire but they don't prepare themselves. They don't know how to prepare themselves.",Faculty,man
ID7,Challenges,"When the reading workshop is developed we're going to say these are some things that our students, these are some areas. Or when we give the students the pre, the interactive test and they score low in these certain areas we take these results. This is what we're finding that our students are not understanding. They're not grasping these things.",Faculty,man
ID7,Challenges,"I think that too as I said before, I think what happens that people who write the tests really are not really thinking because they're not aware of the process. They're not aware of the process that the students learn. If you've never been in a classroom, if you've never been in a classroom you don't have any idea. If you know Common Core Standards and you hear about all this but what happens when you get that student who did not go to, who came to first grade and didn't go to kindergarten and that student is a year behind. That students goes to the process and that student is always going to be one year behind. Those students they keep moving to high school and they're still behind.",Faculty,man
ID7,Challenges,"And you deal with that late bloomer, a six year old, learning all that other stuff and then these students are still, these students are based on Common Core Standards these students are still supposed to align up with those students all across the country.

We have reading workshops. We have people coming in to work with the students and within that class one on Mondays say, for example, we work through some reading things related to reading. Or we work through some things for math and we work through some things for writing. On Wednesday it's a lab. Actually we have students actually taking the pretest.

ID7,Curriculum,Abigail works with me. She developed a workshop and she actually walked through that process. How do you create a thesis statement? What are you looking for? What are some questions? When you talk about supporting details what are you talking about?,Faculty,man
ID7,Curriculum,"And you deal with that late bloomer, a six year old, learning all that other stuff and then these students are still, these students are based on Common Core Standards these students are still supposed to align up with those students all across the country.

So they got into groups. It might have been a group of two. They got into groups and they worked on commas. Why do you have that comma there? Structure, how do you write a thesis statement? So they got into groups. We actually used Lev Vygotsky's theory in terms of having them together to learn from each other. Talk about it.",Faculty,man

She couldn't read necessarily to us that much but she told us stories. Then she got me in Head Start. That really changes things. I'm just thinking of how that period from one to five is just and we know now with all the research that's going on that that period is really important. So how do you stop that cycle? I hope they're going to get compulsory kindergarten.",Faculty,man
ID7,Inspiration,"I love what I do. I know that I'm on this side of it, on this side of the line and I can only do so much. But I know it is so important and so crucial that these students, that these people get it because they're on this side. What I want to do, whatever that I have I'm going to pour into them and I want them to have it. I am going to stress to them it is important. Right now it doesn't seem important but it is. It's very important right now. So whatever I know, I tell them I said I don't know everything. You know some things that I don't know. But the things that I know I am going to share with you and my expectations are here. My expectations are so high for you guys because I believe that you can pass the Praxis. I am and along with my colleagues and other resource people, we are going to work with you and give you all of the materials that we think we can afford so that you have the options, so that you have the resources so that you can look at it and work at it and pass. So for me it's like, you know what, I'm not doing it for me. I already told you I retired once. It's not about me. It's about all of those students, the students that I'm working with. It's about them understanding. If you talk about going into teaching I mean you're not talking about teaching yourself. You're talking about teaching hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of children.

We talk about it, we talk about the theories, all the theories and it's okay now I need for you guys to get into groups and I need for you to tell, I need for you to create a scenario in that group. What does it look like in the classroom? I walk into your classroom as a principal can I see constructivism going on? Can I see social linguistic stuff going on? Do I see it? Do I see students working in groups? If they're working in groups that tells me that you understand Lev Vygotsky's theory students learn from each other. We do it. We do it in the classroom and then on Wednesdays we give them some sheets, worksheets. We don't call them worksheets but we call them activity sheets where they have to get into a group and talk about it. Why is this answer the way it is based on the theory that you've already covered?

You sit and you work on it. Then at the end of the day, at the end of that time you missed say 12 or 50 or whatever and then it tells you what they are, what the answers are. So that tells you right away, you know what, I'm having problems with geometry. So that means I need to work on my geometry. I need to get an eighth grade book.

ID7,Standardized Testing,"I think also that when you design a test I think it should not be so, should I say, I can't think of the word for it, centered around what's going on now. I say that because ten years from now they're going to say oh that doesn't work. We're going to remove cursive in third grade. You're aware of that. So they're going to discover ten years ago, ten years from now that we shouldn't have. We should bring back cursive writing. So I'm thinking they're building the test around the now rather than building a test, creating a test that will, is longstanding, the basic skills that you will always need those skills rather than the skills that you need to know right now.",Faculty,man
ID7,Standardized Testing,You know I think some educators are a part of that but I'm thinking more test writers and they're not educators. I think they know what students should or need to know but they don't understand the process of how those students get to know those things.,Faculty,man
ID7,Standardized Testing,"I think that too as I said before, I think what happens that people who write the tests really are not really thinking because they're not aware of the process. They're not aware of the process that the students learn. If you've never been in a classroom, if you've never been in a classroom you don't have any idea. If you know Common Core Standards and you hear about all this but what happens when you get that student who did not go to, who came to first grade and didn't go to kindergarten and that student is a year behind. That students goes to the process and that student is always going to be one year behind. Those students they keep moving to high school and they're still behind.",Faculty,man

The students have an opportunity to number one they're exposed to the skills. They're exposed to materials that will help them pass the test. For example, the reading. We have reading. We have reading workshops. We have people coming in to work with the students and within that class one on Mondays say, for example, we work through some reading things related to reading. Or we work through some things for math and we work through some things for writing. On Wednesday it's a lab. Actually we have students actually taking the pretest. That's why it's so important that we have, that we can afford to buy, purchase the pretest. So we purchased the pretest.",Faculty,man

I just had them come to the lab and do the interactive tests. I also had the workshops and had some people come in and said oh this is working. So I said well I think this should become part of a class. But I think it should become part of a class in addition to a class. So this is a three hour class and taking one of the class periods. It has to be a standalone lab. It has to be a lab where these students attend the class for two days, Monday and Wednesday, and then they should go to the lab.",Faculty,man
ID9,Campus Environment,"The students, there is a variety of students. We get the range of students that are fresh out of high school and I've even had some students into their, gee, I had one student that was 68 at one time. So there's a range of age. The majority of them are concerned about their culture.",Faculty,woman
ID9,Challenges,": It's been interesting. It's been a little bit of a challenge being the fact that this is the first time we've done something like this. There was kind of a challenge with, one of the biggest challenges I had was we were having trouble calculating the number of credits from semester to quarters because SKC does quarter credits and we do semester credits. We were trying to figure out okay if I have four credit class how many hours is that at a semester level. That was kind of one of the challenges. There was in the beginning it was kind of hard getting in touch with them but after we figured out what the best route was for communication that one was resolved pretty quickly",Faculty,woman
ID9,Challenges,"M: Their level is a little weak here. I think the majority of the students when they test they test into either basic math or beginning algebra. It's pretty well that I get, I only get like this semester or this year I had two students that tested into college algebra, which is where they should be starting at. They're scare of it, of math. If I really want to drive a student just off the wall all I have to do is give them a test that has nothing but factions on it. They shut down.",Faculty,woman
ID9,Challenges,"For me it's all about the challenges. When I was teaching at Havre there was no challenge there. You showed up to work, you did your job, you're done. Out here you get such a variety of students out there and you're trying to teach to each one of them and that's the reward I get is the challenges. I would never make it at a desk job where all you have to do is just write things down and turn it in. I need something that will stick with me just a little bit. That's why I stay here.",Faculty,woman
ID9,Classroom Environment,"It's encouragement is what it is, what it amounts to. It doesn't necessarily mean I'm just saying gold star. It's, yes, you got right, absolutely. Encouragement is the idea of that one. I bring up the gold star because I have a student in my pre calc class. She's kind of quiet. She's smart. She's just a little bit slow at doing the process. So if you give her some time she'll get it and she likes that you get a gold star and she just beams, lights up. A lot of students like that. If you tell them, hey, you did a good job on this type thing. It's trying to be critical without being mean is what I'm trying to do.",Faculty,woman
ID9,Cultural Relevance,"M: They look at things, there's probably a handful of them that want to keep their language intact.

ID9,Cultural Relevance,"M: An example of that, with the class I was teaching for SKC we did a couple of, we did like Rocky Boy around pow wow circuit type deal. They had a certain budget and they had to figure out how many pow wows they'd go to and how they were going to spend the money on that type thing.

Then one of the biggest things that helps out with them is I'll give them a review sheet before, a day or two before the test. It's up to them to do it. If they have question they can ask me about it and then if they want to they can use that review sheet on the test. That seems to help a little bit.

So they're learning on perimeter and area and how much do I have to, how much fence do I have to buy in order to give him enough room.

ID11,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,F: It's third grade. So we get to switch. One week is we get the Spanish. The students are mixed in general but where the students go one week in Spanish and one week in English and I'm always in the Spanish. I see a lot of the English dominant students. So we kind of like translate and we use a lot of English more with them than with the Spanish. That's where it differs.,Faculty,woman
ID11,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,My greatest concern right now would be just being effective as a teacher to help the students with all the tests and prepare them because they are hard. Right now I am in third grade so it's their first year taking the test. So I see my teacher working very hard to help them and kind of guide them. So I think that would be my issue of concern how to help them.,Faculty,woman
ID11,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,"Yes, and I think that's very important. We had an issue where we were preparing our science lesson and so we were getting our lesson from the book, from the science book that they're doing. We turned it in and our feedback that our teacher, our NMSU teacher told us this lesson is under grade level. It's for a second grade when you're doing third. The lesson was on matter and the properties of matter, just the properties in general like hardness and shape. So she told us that it was below grade level that by that age they should be doing solids, liquids and gases and separating mixtures and all that. We go well this is what the book said. She asked me if I could take a picture of the book and send it to her. She told us that she hadn't realized that the curriculum had changed. The curriculum doesn't meet or it does in a way but it's not very specific. So she came down here when she was here and she took a look at the book and she said yes that's right. The centers don't really match up to the curriculum because there has been a new curriculum.",Faculty,woman
ID11,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,"F: Just everything, just being in the class and listening to the children respond. It comes from them, to talking to parents. I was able to, my practicum teacher invited me to parent teacher conferences so I was there for a couple of conferences and just getting the experience of how a teacher communicates with the parent and tells them you know what your child is so, or you know what your child is doing very well but you need to still help her. So that was very important. He asked me if I could jump in a little bit with one of the conferences. He asked me well what would you say, just me and him before the parent could come in, would you say. I was describing the child and I was telling him that she's very communicative. She's always talking and whispering. He's like okay wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop. So I'm the parent and you're telling me that my child is always talking. How do you think the parent is going to take that? Just being there and talking to the teacher helps us realize be careful with what you're saying.",Faculty,woman

The lesson was on matter and the properties of matter, just the properties in general like hardness and shape. So she told us that it was below grade level that by that age they should be doing solids, liquids and gases and separating mixtures and all that. We go well this is what the book said. She asked me if I could take a picture of the book and send it to her. She told us that she hadn't realized that the curriculum had changed. The curriculum doesn't meet or it does in a way but it's not very specific. So she came down here when she was here and she took a look at the book and she said yes that's right.

I was able to, my practicum teacher invited me to parent teacher conferences so I was there for a couple of conferences and just getting the experience of how a teacher communicates with the parent and tells them you know what your child is so, or you know what your child is doing very well but you need to still help her. So that was very important. He asked me if I could jump in a little bit with one of the conferences. He asked me well what would you say, just me and him before the parent could come in, would you say. I was describing the child and I was telling him that she's very communicative. She's always talking and whispering. He's like okay wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop. So I'm the parent and you're telling me that my child is always talking. How do you think the parent is going to take that? Just being there and talking to the teacher helps us realize be careful with what you're saying.",Faculty,woman

We've had the opportunity to be actually in the planning and how they work together. We've seen how they work together to do okay so we're doing this lesson and you do it in Spanish and you do it in English.

Teachers would be really, we would be on ourselves individual and so I was scared. But when I started my years it was great. The teachers were really nice. They were always helping us. So I loved it.

ID26,Challenges,"The thing that's most challenge with the Call Me MISTER program would probably be just really kind of serving as a counselor for 15, we're talking about 15, young black men ranging from 18 to 21 years of age. So any time you're dealing with a group of young people at that age you're going to have some unique situations that come up. So my challenge is day in and day out just really trying to maintain contact with them and make sure that they're doing the things that they're supposed to do and that they're making good decisions. When they have problems or issues that come up they usually show up at my door to talk to me. It's basically trying to balance that.",Faculty,woman
ID26,Challenges,"Then the other thing would be finance. Most people think working with this program we say we pay full tuition. They think that everything is covered. That makes it all right for the young men that they don't have any financial difficulties or problems. But what we find out is that's not the case with the program. So, yes, we pay for full tuition and we pay for books but we don't cover room and board. Really that's one of the things that I didn't really understand because room and board is central to the program. If you're trying to have people live together and go through classes together I would think that room and board would be one of the main things that you provided for because, again, that's at the heart of the program. So they have some financial challenges with that and it's not as much for the state people as it is for the out of state people because they pay the extra probably close to $10,000 a year just for out of state fees",Faculty,woman
ID26,Classroom Environment,"we encourage the research process greatly. Each year we take a cohort and we apply for the Center for Undergraduate Research mini grant. They give us about $5,000 to support travel to different conferences. So each year I work with a different cohort. So Cohort 1 presented at the NAAS Conference down in Baton Rouge last year. This year I took Cohort 2, well it was mostly Cohort 2. There were a couple from Cohort 1. We went down there and presented again. This year what I have students to do was actually interview African American male teachers in local elementary schools. So, again, they can get a sense of what they were getting into and then they presented on their research. So each year we're going to make sure that each of the cohorts get that experience as an undergraduate researching.",Faculty,woman
ID26,Cohort Model,we mentor young men throughout the program. We get them a lot of early experiences in the field working and teaching with children and then we provide them with support throughout the program in order to make sure that they're successful. So that's the general model that all of us follow.,Faculty,woman
ID26,Cohort Model,"they allow us the freedom to decide exactly how we're going to implement that and then they provide us with whatever support that we needs. So here at Jackson State basically what we do, again, we have it set up where the initial year that they come in we work with the students. Again, we get them set up with mentors out in the schools. We also provide them with experiences to serve and working with young kids along with taking their courses. We utilize the cohort model. So each year we select five students and the cohort model is intentional. We want to bring in a small number so we can actually make sure that we're effective in what we're doing. So when we bring in the five, again, we work with them. We set it up where they can live together in housing and also I set up their schedules where all of them take their classes together or as many classes together as possible. So, again, they're going to matriculate through the program together and that way they can be that support system for them.",Faculty,woman
ID26,Cohort Model,"At the end of their first year in the program we require that they go to Clemson for the summer for the Clemson internship. Again, we want them to have that experience where initially so they can really get a sense of what the program is about and spend time with graduates of the program and also the MISTER's from around the country so they can get that sense. After that initial summer we set it up where they get a choice now. So they can either go to Clemson or they can stay here in the state of Mississippi and we'll set them up with their own internship. So we've had MISTER's that have served at, in Cohort 1 they've done both. They've been to Clemson; they've stayed here in Jackson, Mississippi. Cohort 2, which is our sophomores right now, they've been to Clemson and then Cohort 3, which are our freshmen this year, they will be required to go to Clemson.",Faculty,woman

They have responsibility to give back and make their community better when they go through the program. That's number one for me and it is one that I kind of harp on because I think it's one that we're struggling with a little bit. We see growth but it's one of the things that I would like to see us improve on a little bit more is students not just having personal responsibility but taking responsibility for their cohort member or taking responsibility for the other MISTER's. So if you see someone in need of help, if someone is struggling in math and you know you're good in math why aren't you helping them. Why do they have to come to me or why do I have to recommend that you go help your friend out because you all are living together. You all see each other more than I do. So it's something that I would like for them to get to the point where it comes really naturally. So that's one of the basic tenets.",Faculty,woman

So we're giving them awards for highest GPA this year. We have like an athletic competition award so between the cohorts. So which cohort wins the most basketball games, shoots the best, at archery, those type things. We also have like an attendance award for events and then we're going to do like one overall called Call Me MISTER or something like this who is really exemplifying the qualities of a MISTER. So again that's something that they get really excited about and again the whole transparency of putting everything on the board kind of helps out with that process.",Faculty,woman

ID26,Future Plans,"One of the things that I've been thinking about adding a little component for next year is actually having them get involved a little bit in the political process. We focus in on teaching and service. We focus in on research but up to this point we've pretty much ignored the political process. I think this is an ideal time particularly in the state of Mississippi for them to kind of get a feel for that. So, again, we just want them to have a lot of tools to be able to draw from when they go into the classroom. So whichever route they choose to take they will be equipped to handle it.",Faculty,woman

But the Call Me MISTER program was what changed that for him, getting involved with this now and he's been here three years and he really wants to be a teacher after being involved in this program.

ID26,Job Counseling,I'm expecting them to be great teachers. I see a lot of potential. The good thing about the program is again the way it's structured. They get a lot of early field experiences. So by the time they begin their sophomore year they probably spend as much time in the field as our juniors here going through the traditional program. During the summers they spend probably 2 ½ months of full days in the classroom. It's not observation type work. They're either co-teaching or some of those in the upper class are teaching the classrooms themselves. So they're getting a ton of experience early on in the classroom.,Faculty,woman

ID26,Mentorship,"at the end of their freshman year they're required to go to Clemson and do that internship. So we had talked to all of them and gotten them ready. I sent out a text a couple of days before just telling everybody make sure that you had everything packed up and ready to go. He never replied back to me. He wanted to go to a Lil Boosie concert that summer and it was basically during the concert was going to take place during the time of the internship. We told him that there's no way for him to get back for the concert. So in his mind he wasn't going to go. So now we're looking at the mentality at that point in time. The day before I hadn't heard from him. I just called him and invited him out for lunch. We went out and got some barbeque and just sat down and talked. Just from our conversation, because I had an idea that he hadn't planned on going. He just wasn't going to say anything and was going to miss the van or whatever. But from that conversation he decided to go up there and he really enjoyed the experience and it changed. When he came back to begin that fall you could see the whole change in his mentality and he has become one of the leaders in the program now. In terms of whatever we do he's one of the first to volunteer for it, one of the first ones to step out front in what it is they're trying to do. So little successes like that is what helps keep all of us going that work with the program when we can see the growth in the students that we're working with.",Faculty,woman
ID26,Mentorship,"just from working with them and what I've found is that some of our most intelligent kids didn't do well in high school. So it's kind of interesting and it may or may not translate over into college. So we've had some that didn't do well in high school, didn't score well on ACT, come into college and are doing great. Then we've had vice versa where some of them had high ACT scores, I mean we don't have any with a high ACT that are failing or anything but they did come in at the level that we expected. So we're really getting a mix range at least from among the MISTER's. I think what partially contributes to that is just the amount of stuff that they're engaged in and involved in. So they're juggling a lot of different things, not just coursework. The things that we're asking them to do and then they're getting all of this extra attention for being a part of this program and then all of their personal interests that they want to do some of everything at college. One of the things that I see them struggling with the most is just really trying to figure out how do we juggle all of these things that we want to do and how do we make decisions that are going to be best for us.",Faculty,woman

They can change the whole perspective on my day. When they're doing well that can make my day go very, very well. I can be having a great day and then one of them walks in my office and just messes it all up.

But coming here I'm seeing we're 44% Latino and that was exciting to me. I don't see that reflected in our teacher ed program, which is a concern. We're trying to recruit more of our Latino students into the program especially bilingual. We don't have as many bilingual students as we would like. 
",Faculty,woman
ID12,Campus Environment,"Yeah, it's across the board. A lot of our students are in the criminal justice program, which is an excellent program here at New Mexico State. Then we have students that are in business. So our Latino students tend to gravitate towards those social services rather than education. So it was something that I thought was really interesting when I first came. I was thinking, I was expecting to see a lot more Latino students in our classrooms but we're not seeing the numbers that I would have expected. It varies from one semester to the other. Sometimes we'll have more bilingual students and again this is New Mexico. It's a unique state in that they have a bilingual constitution. So in the constitution we're obligated to offer bilingual services to all of our students whether they be Native American with the Pueblo languages or here with the Spanish language. So that's unique. I don't know that a lot of our students realize that when they come into the program.",Faculty,woman
ID12,Campus Environment,"F: Yes, when the constitution was originally written that was always part of the constitution. Like I said, New Mexico is a unique state in that a lot of the Chicanos and a lot of the Spanish that came here early on they made sure that their rights were preserved whereas when you go over to Texas it's very different or even Arizona. New Mexico is unique in that way.",Faculty,woman
ID12,Challenges,"they get anywhere from 37 to 40 something hours as semester. So they don't get as much time but a lot of those are some of our more nontraditional students. They have families that they can't, or they have jobs that they really can't be in the school that long. We try to accommodate those students as well. My expectations for them are pretty similar. They still have to do a lesson planning, they still have to do the teaching",Faculty,woman
ID12,Challenges,ve had some students say that they had such a poor experience that they want it to be different and so that's why they're in. I've had several students who told me about that but not saying that they didn't want to be teachers because they had such a poor experience.,Faculty,woman
ID12,Challenges,"We haven't done that in our methods courses. That's something that we talk about. I do a lesson on using technology in the classroom and understanding what that means for our young people. The teachers, the classroom teachers themselves they take them through practice tests. PARCC offers, the state offers them a chance to practice but they also do that because of the infrastructure we want to make sure. I think the first year they tried it they crashed all over the state. Some districts are very rural. They don't have access and the same broad bandwidth is very concerning. Then a lot of them had older computers and all those kinds of things that they're trying to mitigate at this point.",Faculty,woman

ID12,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,"As I mentioned before, we have two semesters of Block before the students student teach. The On-Site Block, which is what we're talking about here, the students spend anywhere from 120 to 150 hours a semester in the classroom with the teacher. Then they have seminar courses which are content courses outside of that. So our students are with the teachers in the classroom with the students working every day Monday through Thursday pretty much 7:30 in the morning until 11:00 in the morning. So they get about 3 ½ hours a day. Then our seminar is on Wednesdays so they cut short in the classroom and they come in and learn about the methods courses. So we do a lot of observations. I teach the science methods course so my students have to plan lessons for science and then I watch them. I observe them teach and go through the science lessons.",Faculty,woman
ID12,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,"My background comes from K State and we actually had an, ours wasn't on-site but I actually got to, we had a practicum piece that was separate from our methods courses. I was in charge of the practicum as well as my methods course that I taught which was science methods. So I learned a lot about how lesson planning works and those kinds of things because they have a really strong PDS program there and I learned from my mentor. So when I came here I kind of brought a lot of that with me. So I do a lot of lesson planning development within my seminar course. So not only are they learning the science methods they're learning how that applies in practice with their lesson plans. Then we do observe them in the classroom as much as we can.",Faculty,woman
ID12,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,"we have an integrated model so the three professors and I that we all teach the four courses kind of together.

So every other week or every third week one of us is taking the lead in the seminar course. So, yes, we teach the seminar course at the site. So that's in the spring and we're at North Valley where you were meeting our students. In the fall we're here in Las Cruces. So we alternate the Block. We have two Blocks going concurrently in any given semester. So there's Block B right now is over at Central Elementary. I think you met Violet Henderson earlier today. So she's teaching the reading and the literacy courses over there at that Block and I'm over at North Valley. Then in the fall I'll go to Central and they'll go to North Valley. We kind of switch it out.",Faculty,woman
ID12,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,"We also have an evening Block for those students that can't come and be in the on-site because it's a really large time commitment to be in the on-site program. We have an evening Block. In the spring we teach what's called I-TV which is interactive television because we have three satellite schools in the state that are a part of NMSU but they're in Alamogordo, which is about an hour and fifteen minutes away, Carlsbad, which is about three hours away and Grants, which is four hours away. So they see me on a TV monitor, me and the other instructors teaching the Block. So they take their courses that way. Then we have a representative there that places them in the schools. But even still the evening Block the requirement, the hours are much less than they are for on-site Blocks. So they only, I think they get anywhere from 37 to 40 something hours as semester. So they don't get as much time but a lot of those are some of our more nontraditional students. They have families that they can't, or they have jobs that they really can't be in the school that long. We try to accommodate those students as well. My expectations for them are pretty similar. They still have to do a lesson planning, they still have to do the teaching. I don't get to observe them because their schedules are all over the place but we do have people, the ones that are here in Las Cruces we have people that go out and observe them teach in the classrooms and work with the classroom teachers.",Faculty,woman
ID12,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,"I think our strength is the time that the students get in the classroom, that they actually get to work with practicing teachers and they get to see, especially for that management piece that a lot of the principals say that kids need to know how to manage the classroom, their students do. Unless you're in a classroom, I can assign a textbook and have them read about it and have them do case studies all day long but until they have to actually manage children then they don't have the same, you can't really get that experience.",Faculty,woman
ID12,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,"I was observing one of my students today and she was teaching a sixth grade science lesson. So after about probably about 30 minutes or so and the activity she started losing them. So knowing how to either bring them back or make sure that they stay on task with what they're doing is a challenge. So that's something that they have to learn and we have to try to show them how do to do that. We try to do that when we walk in and take over the classroom sometimes if we have to. Then the teacher is also, they all have their own strategies and what works for them. The other thing, the other good thing is they get to work with different teachers.",Faculty,woman
ID12,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,"In Block A, in the first Block the faculty, either me or whoever I'm working with, we will meet the students the first day. We get their names and a lot of times we'll ask them if they're bilingual TESOL. We'll need to know that because we try to place those in those classroom, in the dual language classrooms. We get their language skills and whether or not they're comfortable speaking Spanish or what level and where they are. Then we will place them because at this point I've been in the classroom, I've been with the schools three years so I know the teachers fairly well. So I kind of try to but we're still kind of hit and miss sometimes because we don't know the students that well. In Block B, the second block, I give recommendations to the faculty for that block which students might work with which teacher. So then they usually go with my recommendations. Sometimes they have to move them around but that's how we do it. We just personally do that. We place them ourselves.",Faculty,woman

They do that for me and I know they do that for Dr. -0:21:32- and I think Dr. -0:21:33- also requires that. So for every lesson they teach they have to do a reflection. Then they also do what we call Praxis journals.,Faculty,woman

So every week they have one due whether it's for me, Dr. -0:21:58- whoever is assigned for that week. Then that's actually where they get a chance to, we may give them an article to read and say okay so now think about your classroom from this week. What kinds of things have you observed in your classroom that might align with this or that you might use some of these activities in. So, yes, so they have to do that every week. That's part of, that's actually part of our program is to be responsive and reflective.",Faculty,woman
ID12,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,"Before we had to leave for the whole testing window which they were out for a month last year. But this year what she allowed them to do is if their classroom is testing then they got to go and observe in another classroom. So some of our Special Education students that are majoring or focusing on that they got to go observe in a Special Ed classroom and got to talk with those teachers, with the counselors and those types of things. But we do address it. I don't say that because it does impact the students when they're in their testing window. What I do tell them is that it's something that's necessary, it's something we have to be aware of. So the methods that we're trying to teach you or they're good teaching methods and hopefully you'll be able to institute some of those when you go into the classroom and get your students ready for the tests rather than teaching to the tests.",Faculty,woman

They'd go over there because they knew they were going to get something to eat.",Faculty,man

I've got a lot of students that didn't finish so I had to report them and they owe all this money because they signed that payback agreement.

You can go by the culture then you're using their language and they're singing their songs, they're learning. They're sitting there respectfully and plus they get to eat. A lot of them come to school to eat because like I said we have a lot of poverty up here. We see a lot of hungry students. We have the learning center where they provide food.

Sometimes they are tired and sometimes they are taking care of daytime. So having the practicum during the day is really difficult but they save money before they take those courses so they can actually do it. So they are that committed, sacrificing a lot of different things to be able to have this experience and be prepared as teachers. We have students that not all of our students are Hispanic necessarily but I think that they are passionate about teaching. If they are not having that experience they will recognize that and they will move to another area if that is what they choose, which is good.",Faculty,woman

Another way is we have a lot of readings about different situations, different I would say social issues that students may have, families may have. So we discuss about that and we try to connect to what is going on in the classroom site and looking at students in that way. As I always say I tell the students that teaching the math is important but being there for the students is more important.

So having those experiences and sharing what happened with me at that time and what I learned and what I did that wasn't good and all that that may help them to feel that if we fail it's not because we want to fail but it's because we are learning through that process.

ID22,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,When I was teaching it was from 7:30 until 10:00 they were in the classroom with the teacher and the students.

So they had the opportunity to receive the seminar or to be there during the seminar time in Spanish. Sometimes in their school they have Spanish days or English days.

We're going to have, we had four kindergarten teachers when they were in kindergarten, and now we're down to three kindergarten teachers, and they went to first grade. Now they're coming to second, and we're going to have, no, no, they're coming to third, so I'll have four third grade classrooms, so it all depends on the grouping. We just move teachers around. It stays pretty stable with the number of teachers, it is very much like from 380 to 4-something. It goes up and down.

ID25,Challenges,"F: I think many of them are just wanting to get a career and they have jobs. A lot of them are not only going to school but they work and this is what they're preparing themselves to do. The expectation is for them to get hand on learning in the classroom and just get experience with the students. I guess all of the ones I have mentored, they have two jobs. They're not just students staying at home and making ends meet. There are some that are just barely making their ends meet and they have two jobs, so they're struggling too. They're struggling.",Faculty,woman
ID25,Challenges,"F: Most of them have been single. I only have mentored a couple that have been married, they're trying to raise a family and go to school so they have to work. But the girl that I have right now, she works in El Paso, she lives in Sandland Park and she goes to MSU, so it's a lot of traveling, and I think she works late in El Paso. But I think a lot of them have to do that. That's normal for them, that's what they're doing. Sometimes when see her, I have some kind of a block when my kids go to Art in the morning, and I see her go looking through her books. I try to let her just get a sense of where she needs to be in her class work, but also I think she needs to do it in the classroom. I allow her some time for her to just get ready, because she's a person just like me. She has a family and she has a different life besides being in the classroom.",Faculty,woman
ID25,Challenges,"We are dealing with a student right now, she has a lot of issues. Sometimes she pulls back and looks and then she goes I don't know what I would have done. I go, you know what? When you are there, you know what to do. You just have to be prepared for a lot. He throws tantrums. He loses it, and I have to call the office for them to get him. We have to take him to the room and we have to take a long walk and take the kids to the bathroom when he has been removed from the classroom and walk back in when he is removed. She learns about that. You do tell them the community. It is a poor community, low socioeconomic issues. One parent, a lot of one parent families at times. The reason they go to Chamborino, -0:13:24.9-, the area they come from is a low socioeconomic area, it is because a lot of them cannot afford housing in the city, in the bigger cities, so they tend to go out of the urban areas to the farming areas where we have more options for them in low rent. Usually the standards are lower too. So, she gets to see that on the students. We do deal with a lot of socioeconomic issues here.",Faculty,woman
ID25,Challenges,"Let me see; the challenges I face. I think the opportunities are great. There are a lot of positions right now for bilingual education, especially within Los Cruces public schools. They are always hiring and trying to recruit a lot of the teachers, especially from this district, that live in the area, and because of their program, their bilingual programs, the opportunities are great. The challenges are that we still, now with the new math program we have a lot, I think a couple of years, you don't find a lot of books. If you go to the book room right now, you have maybe six shelves of English guided reading books that the kids can use. If you go to the book room, it has two shelves of Spanish, so there is a lot of discrepancy between the resources we can use as bilingual teachers and the resources, even though we are a bilingual district, a lot of funding goes into that, we get like 25 percent of what they have. The resources are not there, and we try our hardest to make it. We have all big books that we use for reading in the classroom. A lot of your literacy parts of it, any kind of fairy tale, we have some, but when you come to the sciences, you can use integrated science in social studies into the reading, with reading, there is really nothing, nothing, so the challenge is the resources that we have. We don't have as much resources as we would like. And sometimes even the book that, especially with the new Common Core, a lot of Lucy Culkins is being used. I have to go home and type everything out in Spanish and paste it over the words so they could get the sense of that, and I'm thinking some teachers, how many are spending, I mean, it's a lot of time. I try to do it, especially the main ones. A lot of the resources at work, even to teach with the Common Core, we're not there yet as a bilingual district. It is a lot of hard work, a lot of late days trying to translate a lot of that stuff.",Faculty,woman

We were with DOTS and he was working in Korea and then we went to Germany for quite a while, and so when I was there I finished my education and then I got involved with the Armed Forces, and working for the United States Army, I was training people how to write resumes and stuff like that, and I was working -0:01:29.6- program at the high school, at the middle school.

Because any time that she has she sort of goes back to that corner. I go you know what? When you've got this low grade right here, you got a two, is because I want you to mingle with the students. I want you to talk to them. Get to know who they are, where they are, what are their likes and dislikes? What are their needs?

So each year I work with a different cohort. So Cohort 1 presented at the NAAS Conference down in Baton Rouge last year. This year I took Cohort 2, well it was mostly Cohort 2. There were a couple from Cohort 1. We went down there and presented again. This year what I have students to do was actually interview African American male teachers in local elementary schools.

ID26,Opportunities,"We have one young man that actually came to Jackson State and the only reason he came here was to play in the Sonic Boom. So the band attracted him. His original plan was to come here and stay a year and play in the Boom and then I guess he was going to leave, I don't know, and go back to his home state. But the Call Me MISTER program was what changed that for him, getting involved with this now and he's been here three years and he really wants to be a teacher after being involved in this program. Initially that was a student that we were going to lose just because he didn't really think he could afford to stay here, for one, and it was never in his long range plan to graduate from this university. I see with that young man we've already made a difference in that aspect.",Faculty,woman
ID26,Opportunities,"at the end of their freshman year they're required to go to Clemson and do that internship. So we had talked to all of them and gotten them ready. I sent out a text a couple of days before just telling everybody make sure that you had everything packed up and ready to go. He never replied back to me. He wanted to go to a Lil Boosie concert that summer and it was basically during the concert was going to take place during the time of the internship. We told him that there's no way for him to get back for the concert. So in his mind he wasn't going to go. So now we're looking at the mentality at that point in time. The day before I hadn't heard from him. I just called him and invited him out for lunch. We went out and got some barbeque and just sat down and talked. Just from our conversation, because I had an idea that he hadn't planned on going. He just wasn't going to say anything and was going to miss the van or whatever. But from that conversation he decided to go up there and he really enjoyed the experience and it changed. When he came back to begin that fall you could see the whole change in his mentality and he has become one of the leaders in the program now. In terms of whatever we do he's one of the first to volunteer for it, one of the first ones to step out front in what it is they're trying to do. So little successes like that is what helps keep all of us going that work with the program when we can see the growth in the students that we're working with.",Faculty,woman
ID26,Pedagogy,I was hooked because it really matched what they were saying about the program really matched my general philosophy of education. They talked about a program that believed in investing in young men that had the desire to teach and helping them be successful and then in return they were going to further their model. They would know how to go out in the schools and work with other young people and invest in them. So that matched up very well with what I believed and I've been working with the program ever since.,Faculty,woman
ID26,Pedagogy,we mentor young men throughout the program. We get them a lot of early experiences in the field working and teaching with children and then we provide them with support throughout the program in order to make sure that they're successful. So that's the general model that all of us follow.,Faculty,woman
ID26,Pedagogy,"they allow us the freedom to decide exactly how we're going to implement that and then they provide us with whatever support that we needs. So here at Jackson State basically what we do, again, we have it set up where the initial year that they come in we work with the students. Again, we get them set up with mentors out in the schools. We also provide them with experiences to serve and working with young kids along with taking their courses. We utilize the cohort model. So each year we select five students and the cohort model is intentional. We want to bring in a small number so we can actually make sure that we're effective in what we're doing. So when we bring in the five, again, we work with them. We set it up where they can live together in housing and also I set up their schedules where all of them take their classes together or as many classes together as possible. So, again, they're going to matriculate through the program together and that way they can be that support system for them.",Faculty,woman
ID26,Pedagogy,"At the end of their first year in the program we require that they go to Clemson for the summer for the Clemson internship. Again, we want them to have that experience where initially so they can really get a sense of what the program is about and spend time with graduates of the program and also the MISTER's from around the country so they can get that sense. After that initial summer we set it up where they get a choice now. So they can either go to Clemson or they can stay here in the state of Mississippi and we'll set them up with their own internship. So we've had MISTER's that have served at, in Cohort 1 they've done both. They've been to Clemson; they've stayed here in Jackson, Mississippi. Cohort 2, which is our sophomores right now, they've been to Clemson and then Cohort 3, which are our freshmen this year, they will be required to go to Clemson.",Faculty,woman

ID26,Pedagogy,"would like the MISTER's to basically say that, look, they realize that they have a responsibility and their responsibility is not just to themselves but it's to their brothers that are going through the Call Me MISTER program and also to their community. They have responsibility to give back and make their community better when they go through the program. That's number one for me and it is one that I kind of harp on because I think it's one that we're struggling with a little bit. We see growth but it's one of the things that I would like to see us improve on a little bit more is students not just having personal responsibility but taking responsibility for their cohort member or taking responsibility for the other MISTER's. So if you see someone in need of help, if someone is struggling in math and you know you're good in math why aren't you helping them. Why do they have to come to me or why do I have to recommend that you go help your friend out because you all are living together. You all see each other more than I do. So it's something that I would like for them to get to the point where it comes really naturally",Faculty,woman
ID26,Pedagogy,"ambassadorship. So we want them to really be able to get out and tell their stories. These guys have really unique stories. Again like I said, we have MISTER's that came in on academic probation. We have MISTER's that came in at the top of their class and they're all kind of going through this experience together.",Faculty,woman
ID26,Recruitment,"Now in terms of how we choose our MISTER's I think that's something that's really, well, it's not unique to just Jackson State but I think the Call Me MISTER program is unique in that it's not a, it's a scholarship program but it's not a traditional scholarship program in that we don't just cater to the highest achieving students. So if you look at our 15 MISTER's at Jackson State we have students that came in on Presidential Scholarship but we also have students that came in taking remedial courses. So what we've done we selected them and we grouped them all together and we're hoping that through that support system with them going through classes as a cohort and with us providing them with extra support that they're going to ensure that all of them can make it.",Faculty,woman
ID26,Recruitment,"So basically what we do in terms of recruiting is each year we do a newsletter highlighting the accomplishments that they made the year before. The MISTER's write part of it, I write part of it and we kind of edit it together and send it out. We send it to all of the principals and counsels in the state of Mississippi. Then we also send it out to different organizations, maybe some local churches and so forth. Around this time of March and April our MISTER's start going out and they start talking to the students in local high schools in the Jackson area high schools that may be interested in the program. So some of the visits I set up and some of them they set up themselves and they go out and handle it. So usually what we end up having is three maybe four guys at a high school that have some interest in it and they go and talk to them and tell them about the program and hopefully out of that one or two may apply.",Faculty,woman
ID26,Recruitment,"So once that's done by the end of the academic year we want to have that cohort chosen. So we go through an interview process. Initially they apply online. So we go through and we look through the applications online and we get a selected group and contact them for interviews. Our MISTER's participate in the interview process because, again, we want to make sure that they feel like they have ownership in this program because this is their program. So we invite in a couple of local principals, a couple of professors and then the MISTER's are sitting in on the interview panel. We interview students and everyone has an equal vote in who gets elected. Once we've decided we let them know and before the academic year is ended we've selected five. So that way we can go ahead and get finance and everything straightened out so they can enter into the school year early. We also do that because Clemson University has a Call Me MISTER Institute in June and we want those five new ones to be able to attend that three day institute so they can get a sense of what they're coming into for the upcoming year. So that in general is pretty much how our program is set up.",Faculty,woman
ID26,Recruitment,"We just ask them to tell us about why they're interested in teaching, some of their experiences working with young children, just those types of things. It's general questions. Just tell me a little bit about yourself and what drives you. So, again, we just really try to get a sense of who they are.",Faculty,woman
ID26,Reflection,"I've always wanted to be a professor at a historically black college. Initially as an undergraduate I went to Tougaloo College, a historically black, small historically black college not far from here. While I was there though I majored in psychology. I decided once I completed that I was going to go into the field of education. I went out to Oklahoma State University. While I was out at Oklahoma State University that's when I was really in the process of grappling with trying to understand my undergraduate experience at Tougaloo College. Again that kind of led me into my dissertation and in the research that I was doing. But with me really trying to make sense of that experience all while I was going through graduate school.

ID26,Resources,"they allow us the freedom to decide exactly how we're going to implement that and then they provide us with whatever support that we needs. So here at Jackson State basically what we do, again, we have it set up where the initial year that they come in we work with the students. Again, we get them set up with mentors out in the schools. We also provide them with experiences to serve and working with young kids along with taking their courses. We utilize the cohort model. So each year we select five students and the cohort model is intentional. We want to bring in a small number so we can actually make sure that we're effective in what we're doing. So when we bring in the five, again, we work with them. We set it up where they can live together in housing and also I set up their schedules where all of them take their classes together or as many classes together as possible. So, again, they're going to matriculate through the program together and that way they can be that support system for them.",Faculty,woman
ID26,Resources,"Our goal is that, yes, they have to put those four years in a Mississippi classroom. Yes, we want to keep them around. We want them to have the skillset to either stay in the classroom, become consultants, become administrators but stay in the field of education and hopefully stay here in the state of Mississippi so we can make a difference in our community right here. So, yes, teaching is at the center and the core of what we do and we want them to be able to advocate for the children. We're talking about minorities, male or female. We want them to be able to advocate for whomever ends up in their classrooms.",Faculty,woman
ID26,Standardized Testing,"If you get a 21 or above you're exempt in Mississippi from just the first one, from Praxis I or Case now. We have two that have passed two parts but they didn't pass writing. So they really need to focus in on writing. I would say that's one weakness that we're seeing kind of across the board and not just in Call Me MISTER but in education in general is writing.",Faculty,woman
ID26,Student Needs,"A couple of stories I'll share with you all really quick. We have one young man that actually came to Jackson State and the only reason he came here was to play in the Sonic Boom. So the band attracted him. His original plan was to come here and stay a year and play in the Boom and then I guess he was going to leave, I don't know, and go back to his home state. But the Call Me MISTER program was what changed that for him, getting involved with this now and he's been here three years and he really wants to be a teacher after being involved in this program. Initially that was a student that we were going to lose just because he didn't really think he could afford to stay here, for one, and it was never in his long range plan to graduate from this university. I see with that young man we've already made a difference in that aspect.",Faculty,woman
ID26,Student Needs,"Weekly basis, some of them are coursework things, other are conflict. We have to decide what do I do. I'm pledging and you all want us to do this and I'm involved in this organization and I need to go here and them making decision, okay, what am I going to do. We have issues, general college student issues where students might get in trouble in the dorm. Somebody brought some alcohol on campus and this is a campus that's closed. So it can be anything. It's just a wide, wide range of things that we have students deal with. Again, with all that my philosophy is I'm not here to get you out of trouble. I'm here to help you make good decisions. So whatever it is that you have to deal with I'm here to talk to you about it and help, try to help lead you to the responsible decision. But again at the end of the day you're a grownup and it's your decision to make and you're going to determine how you handle it. But again I'm going to advise you but it's your decision ultimately.",Faculty,woman
ID26,Support System,"M: So no two programs are exactly the same but, again, we follow the general idea that, look, we mentor young men throughout the program. We get them a lot of early experiences in the field working and teaching with children and then we provide them with support throughout the program in order to make sure that they're successful. So that's the general model that all of us follow.",Faculty,woman
ID26,Support System,"Now, again, they allow us the freedom to decide exactly how we're going to implement that and then they provide us with whatever support that we needs.

ID26,Support System,"One of the things that I really want to come out of this is the idea that I'm my brother's keeper. That's actually one of the basic tenets of the program. I would like the MISTER's to basically say that, look, they realize that they have a responsibility and their responsibility is not just to themselves but it's to their brothers that are going through the Call Me MISTER program and also to their community. They have responsibility to give back and make their community better when they go through the program. That's number one for me and it is one that I kind of harp on because I think it's one that we're struggling with a little bit. We see growth but it's one of the things that I would like to see us improve on a little bit more is students not just having personal responsibility but taking responsibility for their cohort member or taking responsibility for the other MISTER's. So if you see someone in need of help, if someone is struggling in math and you know you're good in math why aren't you helping them. Why do they have to come to me or why do I have to recommend that you go help your friend out because you all are living together. You all see each other more than I do. So it's something that I would like for them to get to the point where it comes really naturally. So that's one of the basic tenets.",Faculty,woman

ID26,Support System,"at the end of their freshman year they're required to go to Clemson and do that internship. So we had talked to all of them and gotten them ready. I sent out a text a couple of days before just telling everybody make sure that you had everything packed up and ready to go. He never replied back to me. He wanted to go to a Lil Boosie concert that summer and it was basically during the concert was going to take place during the time of the internship. We told him that there's no way for him to get back for the concert. So in his mind he wasn't going to go. So now we're looking at the mentality at that point in time. The day before I hadn't heard from him. I just called him and invited him out for lunch. We went out and got some barbeque and just sat down and talked. Just from our conversation, because I had an idea that he hadn't planned on going. He just wasn't going to say anything and was going to miss the van or whatever. But from that conversation he decided to go up there and he really enjoyed the experience and it changed. When he came back to begin that fall you could see the whole change in his mentality and he has become one of the leaders in the program now. In terms of whatever we do he's one of the first to volunteer for it, one of the first ones to step out front in what it is they're trying to do. So little successes like that is what helps keep all of us going that work with the program when we can see the growth in the students that we're working with.",Faculty,woman
ID26,Support System,"just from working with them and what I've found is that some of our most intelligent kids didn't do well in high school. So it's kind of interesting and it may or may not translate over into college. So we've had some that didn't do well in high school, didn't score well on ACT, come into college and are doing great. Then we've had vice versa where some of them had high ACT scores, I mean we don't have any with a high ACT that are failing or anything but they did come in at the level that we expected. So we're really getting a mix range at least from among the MISTER's. I think what partially contributes to that is just the amount of stuff that they're engaged in and involved in. So they're juggling a lot of different things, not just coursework. The things that we're asking them to do and then they're getting all of this extra attention for being a part of this program and then all of their personal interests that they want to do some of everything at college. One of the things that I see them struggling with the most is just really trying to figure out how do we juggle all of these things that we want to do and how do we make decisions that are going to be best for us.",Faculty,woman
ID26,Support System,"What I try to do is help support them without telling them what to do. My whole way of working with students is I'll talk to you but you're going to ultimately make the decision because I want you to be able to make decisions. If you're going to work with young children, if you're going to help them in the future you need to be able to recognize this process to know what it's like and help them make decisions without handicapping them by telling them what to do every time.",Faculty,woman
ID26,Support System,"M: I do. I joke about it sometimes. Sometimes they get a little more attention than my nine year old does, at least academically. So, yes, I'm very involved with what they do. They can change the whole perspective on my day. When they're doing well that can make my day go very, very well. I can be having a great day and then one of them walks in my office and just messes it all up. So, again, I do kind of see myself as a father figure and again what I want to do is just help them make good decisions so that they can be the best that they can be in what they're doing.",Faculty,woman

ID26,Support System,"It varies week to week. Some of them I determine solely by myself. Some of them the guys will come to me and say, look, we need to talk about this. We're having a problem. Guys aren't showing up the way they should be showing up or they're late. We might have a whole meeting about that. The next meeting we're going to have is going to be about we just had midterms so it's time to find out how everyone performed in midterms. So we put everybody's grades on the board, on the whiteboard. Yes, and we sit and talk about what the problem is.",Faculty,woman
ID26,Support System,"Yes, but again so we want them to know whether or not their brothers are struggling so again they can be there to help them or if they're not going to class they need to make sure that they're getting there. That's the whole idea of them being in a cohort and going through it together. So, yes, it's transparent. This year we just implemented an awards process. So we're giving them awards for highest GPA this year. We have like an athletic competition award so between the cohorts. So which cohort wins the most basketball games, shoots the best, at archery, those type things. We also have like an attendance award for events and then we're going to do like one overall called Call Me MISTER or something like this who is really exemplifying the qualities of a MISTER. So again that's something that they get really excited about and again the whole transparency of putting everything on the board kind of helps out with that process.",Faculty,woman
ID26,Support System,"Faculty receive them well. They have high expectations for the students and again sometimes they live up them and sometimes they don't in terms of in the classroom. Now in the community they've been great going out and all the principals and the teachers they work with. They've had nothing but high praise for them and the job that they've been able to do with students. That's here in Jackson, Mississippi and at Clemson. Everything that we've ever heard about them has been great. So again I guess our challenge right now is to make sure that, okay, they understand that what you're doing in terms of working with the kids has to translate over into your coursework all the time. You need that in order to graduate. So I mean just because you may feel like you're being prepared pretty well to be a teacher you still have to produce in the classroom in order to get there.",Faculty,woman
ID6,Campus Environment,"I feel that the number one issue that we face here in Mississippi is that there is no compulsory early childhood education. That's a biggie. Again, we look at the different sections in Mississippi. If you go into areas like the Mississippi Delta a kid may not experience any type of formal education until they are six years old.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID6,Campus Environment,"It's not compulsory, no. A small fraction, I don't have the numbers in front of me but I became keenly aware of this when I became superintendent in Yazoo City. I would watch kids go into first grade and there's a kid who has been with his grandmother or aunt his whole time. So he's speaking broken English, knows nothing about formal education. Then you have another child who has been in kindergarten or Head Start and that kid has been going or has some type of formal education since four years old. That kid is way ahead of the other kid. So that's the number one issue compulsory early childhood education. The second big issue is that Mississippi has a funding formula for the public schools. On record it says this is what should be done but that formula has never been fully funded. You're going to hear the terms in Mississippi of MAEP, Mississippi Adequate Education Program. It has never been fully funded and that's the big argument from the 152 school districts in Mississippi. Mississippi is very conservative, very conservative and of course public education is somewhat liberal. There are a lot of private schools in Mississippi, a lot of parochial schools. So when it comes to funding public schools it is terribly underfunded. That's the second issue.

ID6,Campus Environment,"You'll hear me talk about the Mississippi Delta a lot because it is really tragic what's going on there. It should be treated, I think, as a crisis or an epidemic but the state leadership they don't see it that way. It's really tragic. I wouldn't have known how awful it was growing up. I finished high school in 1976 and maybe I just didn't see it. But going back and being superintendent of schools in Yazoo City of which they call that the gateway to the Delta, it was tough. It was tough. It was the hardest job I've ever had in my life.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID6,Campus Environment,33% of all the students were one grade or two grades behind. Somewhere in the neighborhood of 65% or 70% was reading below proficient levels.

The Yazoo Public Schools were 99.9% African American but in both of the elementary schools it was like 95% Caucasian teachers.,Faculty/Admin,man

Things were really looking good until I was recruited back to Jackson State. It was time to go. Yazoo City, as I said, is a very political place. In four years I think we had done as much as we could do, in my estimation. It brought a change to the city. It brought some adrenalin to the city and it sort of woke some of the leaders up in that I guess I was a very polarizing figure for that particular four years.

We put on conferences, reading conferences, urban education conferences. We connect in that we give professional development. Teachers have to have renewal, something called CEU's. So we offer those. In addition to that we started what we call the Curriculum Center. The Curriculum Center is K-12. We hired an assistant principal to run the Curriculum Center. So she is keenly aware.

We put on conferences, reading conferences, urban education conferences. We connect in that we give professional development. Teachers have to have renewal, something called CEU's. So we offer those. In addition to that we started what we call the Curriculum Center. The Curriculum Center is K-12. We hired an assistant principal to run the Curriculum Center. So she is keenly aware.

ID13,Campus Environment,"When I interviewed for the job I observed that my first seven, the first seven Presidents while they were all very distinguished none of them were born in California nor in this area. I grew up just 40 miles from the campus. My grandparents immigrated here from Mexico. My great grandfather helped to build the railroad through the San Joaquin Valley and my grandfather who raised me ended up residing in Hanford which is in Kings County. I went away to college at Berkeley and at Stanford and I served in the UC system for about 23 years. About a year before I became President I decided I wanted to try to be a President because for me it kind of brought everything together. Early on in high school I wanted to focus on leadership and public service but it wasn't until I became a student at Berkeley where I really understood the impact that universities can have on peoples' lives, the transformational impact. So for me serving in a university became kind of a focus of my career as a professor and administrator and how as President. It's deeply meaningful to be here at this time. There's just been an incredible about of support from the community for what we're trying to do.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Campus Environment,"As you said we're both Hispanic serving and we're AANAPISI or Asian American and Native Alaskan Pacific Islander. That's a mouthful. And we're proud of that. You might have heard from our folks as well that over 70% of our students are first in their families to go to college which makes us an even more unique place. Over 60%, probably getting close to 2/3rds are Pell Grant students as well. I think we'll probably be at about 80% first generation very soon just because of the growth that we're seeing. The demand to come here is at an all time high and it's very exciting. It's challenging because we can't accommodate everybody but as I travel around the Central Valley there's just a lot of interest and support and excitement.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Campus Environment,"The focus of my presidency is student success. While the institution had focused on that before I think we're doing it in a much more intensive intentional way. We're getting ready to put together a new strategic plan and that will be at the core of it. So everything that we've done since I've been here has been about investing more in supporting our students and also strengthening our infrastructure to support our students and our faculty, education and research as well. We do applied research here, so a little different than at the research university setting but very exciting and deeply impactful. We have the ag research center in our system opening up in January and we're very excited about that. That's been a real focus as well of my presidency is to look at agriculture and how it can really blossom. This is really the epicenter for agriculture in the whole world. If you were to look at the major industries and players in agriculture you would have them very near Fresno and in and around of many of the major industries. A lot of those folks are alumni but interestingly they had not been as connected to us as they can be and will be. So a lot of focus has been put into that. We're recruiting for a new dean for that college and starting to get more specific with you but that is certainly going to be more and more an area of focus and getting more diverse students in that field as well so that the farm worker's children of all backgrounds and a lot of Hmong farm worker's children as well who are looking at this field.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Campus Environment,"Oh, absolutely. The Southeast Asian population is very important and a growing population. I believe that we have one of the largest percentages of Hmong students in the nation. They came here for political reasons. Many of them have gone into agriculture, the parents have. I'd like to position our college so that we serve a greater diversity of students including more Southeast Asian students and look at different kinds of crops. I think there is lots of potential in that area. We have a 1,000 acre farm where we can do a lot of that experimentation. For example, they weren't growing jalapeno peppers and it's like why wouldn't we do that in Fresno with the population that we have.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Campus Environment,"So that's just one example of just trying to make it a more inclusive dynamic place for everyone. That's very important to me, to our cabinet. We've got almost a completely new cabinet. The one that my predecessor had was together for the most part for ten years and very talented folks. A lot of them were scheduled for retirement so it gave me the chance to search. We have appointed our top choice in every search for candidates. Most of them we now have a majority of cabinet members who graduate from this institution. I did not but the Provost has, our Vice President for Advancement, our Vice President for Administration, my Chief of Staff, our Communications Vice President. They all graduated from here. All but one of them grew up here. So it's got a really distinct flavor of local people and that's important to me because there's this message that goes out across this region from businesses and some public entities that it's very difficult to attract talent. I want to bottle that. I think we've shown that you can bring in really top notch people. We just recruited our athletic director, for example, from the University of Oregon. He help them ascend to the highest level but he grew up in the Valley. So when this job came open he wasn't looking for a new job but we called him and said what do you think. This is a great time to be at Fresno State and we're rising and do you want to join us and he said yes. So we've got a collection of people who care deeply about the campus and the region, who have family, who have friends here. So they have this sense of ownership that goes beyond professional. For me as President that's so meaningful to serve here in my home makes such a huge difference. It's not just 23,000 students. I mean these are folks who sat in the same desks that I did and so I understand a lot of what they've experienced and I want them to succeed. We all believe in them and so that's part of, that's a very important part of why we're here and what we're doing.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Campus Environment,"Well, for me I think conceptually I want everyone here and our 200,000 alumni, 80% of whom live in this region. We have 160,000 alumni right here. So as I travel around to every city in our region they're the mayors and they're the doctors, they're the teachers, they're the professors in the local community colleges or the teachers in the schools and so forth. So I want us all to be on the same page that this institution is about transforming the lives of the students who come here and to position them for the changes that are occurring out in our society in the workforce. So it's all about making sure that they don't just arrive. There hasn't been a huge emphasis on access and I love that. I want to preserve that. There had not been as much of an intentional focus on that person and their experience here and their roadmap to success. I believe that now we have that intentional focus and it's supported at the highest level by our Board of Trustees and by Chancellor White. We have targets for graduation rates and programs and plans but it goes beyond that. It goes to the heart of how we organize our work, so how we schedule classes, how we advise our students, whether we have recreational spaces here. In the past there had been the emphasis was we go to the local high school and play club sports instead of stay here. So it's an emphasis on making sure that every student thrives and that they feel comfortable here and that they spend as much time here. It's not oh I've got to go there for two hours for a class and then running somewhere else whether it's a job or some other obligation. I want to do whatever we can to keep them here for as much as they can be here realizing they have different obligations but making this a place where if you walk through the library at the noon hour you'll see hundreds and hundreds of students and at 5:00 the same. This place is a beehive of activity. Outside not so much. We have a lot of nice days here and I'd love to make the whole campus part of the learning experience in ways that it hasn't so far. With technology you can do that. So that's what I'm thinking about at that highest level. Yes, I think it will translate into higher graduation rates. I actually think the 70% rate that we've set for the next ten years I think, between us, we're going to climb over that much soon just the way we've been climbing. I think we'll climb over it faster.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Campus Environment,"At the end of my first year last year was 52 and they tell me that it will probably be about 55 or so. Some of the faculty feel like I'm pushing this too hard but I'm going to keep pushing because I think that it's that intentionality that it's not just I'm going to get to meet this student and nice having them on campus for a few years. This system, our system was actually built around losing half of our students. The financial formula, the enrollment formula, all of that and if you look at the line, the graduation rate over say the 15 years before it was essentially flat lined around 49% or 50%. So I think that we can change that dramatically. The other effect of doing that is that we'll attract students from all backgrounds, including the children of our alumni. I found that some of our alumni were sending their children elsewhere because they felt like they weren't going to get a quality experience like they may have had when they came.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Campus Environment,Hopefully you'll hear more. We just rolled that out in the fall and that initiative again is about student success but it's also about understanding the changes in technology. So we're moving for them from textbooks to the tablet. Some professors are beginning to customize their own materials. What we've seen is a much higher level of engagement by the students and the faculty in these redesigned courses. We've lower textbook costs by 55%. Actually at Apple last week we had some very interesting conversations about student learning and changing the way in which textbooks are created. They were urging us to have the students in the course write the textbook with the faculty member for the next course. They have found that students who are engaged in that way do better.,Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Campus Environment,"Yeah, and we hadn't thought about it in quite that way but now we are. It has implications for the kind of faculty that we would hire to do that as well. So this program is just starting. We're going to scale it to 5,000, which would be about 20 plus percent of our student body and then eventually scale it up higher. We might have all freshmen eventually in this program in stages. But we've done it all through faculty volunteers so it hasn't been mandated. It's been through inspiring instead of requiring.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Campus Environment,every college in school is involved in it and has faculty in the program. Then we went undergrad and grad as well. It's possible that in a later stage we might look at some groupings by year but for right now we actually had the faculty self-identity. So if that faculty member was teaching a course then that would become a tablet course and then we're going to scale it from there. It's worked out. I think for us it was the right cultural move because it enabled them to be empowered to say I want to get in on that.,Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Campus Environment,"Absolutely. Earlier in my career I had served here as part of the UC Merced campus and worked with a lot of the educators here and Fresno State folks Fresno State has very long term relationships with districts that go beyond individual superintendents and principals. We've been here a hundred years so over that period some really great institutional relationships have been developed. I think that's one of the secrets of the success here. The other is having those strong leaders in different positions whether it's superintendents or school board members, active teachers. I think because so many of them are our alumni that that has really helped to solidify the connections and those alumni have had good experiences because if they had negative experiences it would have been harder. We find ways to stay connected with them. So in a few days I'll be in a room. I was last week in a room with all the Fresno County K-12 superintendents and I'll be in a room again with many of them next week. So there are groupings that get together on a regular basis. The superintendent of Fresno Unified he and I talk almost every day about something and I know the Dean does as well. So those connections are very strong. I think that as we focus even more on success I think we'll find that even more students will want to come here and study whether it's in the credentialing program or other fields that we have across the campus. So I think you'll see those programs becoming stronger and stronger over time.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Campus Environment,I'm with you. You raise a great issue about hunger. I don't know if this came up with your professors but last year a study was done by one of our graduate students who is now on the faculty of our students at Fresno State and found that 30% of our students here at Fresno State were and are food insecure.,Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Campus Environment,"They miss one or two meals a day. They were clearly, it was impacting everything. So we rolled out an initiative beginning last fall and we were just talking at cabinet this morning. We have a philanthropist who's going to buy, essentially we're going to lease them the land. They're going to build this large home on the campus and it will house our cupboard, which is like going to your grandma's and it will have food. We have a temporary space now that's being used extensively. All you have to do is take your card, your ID, and you can pick the things that you need. It's food and toiletries. But with this philanthropist's support we're going to have a house so that the homeless students will be able to stay there for a short period. They can get food and there will actually be a kitchen for cooking demonstrations so that students know. A lot of our students don't cook very often or very much and that might mean that they're spending more than they need to. So we're trying to educate them about that. But dealing with this hunger issue is a high priority for us because I don't think there's any way that they can succeed when they're hungry.",Faculty/Admin,man

We still can't offer them Pell Grants until the DREAM Act is passed. So their financial situation is precarious. A lot of them were suffering in silence because they're the first in their families to go to college. They are the role models and they don't want to say to their parents, in fact their parents might be suffering more. So they suffer in silence. It was this thing, I mean this study has opened my eyes. Some of them were even dumpster diving and just scrounging around. It's like our students have to do that is just so painful to understand and believe. It's been exciting and a lot of our ag alumni are stepping up. They're donating. We have one alum who is one of the largest peach producers in the whole world. They sell the peach cuts to all the school around the nations. So they're giving those to us.

ID13,Experience being a minority student,a study was done by one of our graduate students who is now on the faculty of our students at Fresno State and found that 30% of our students here at Fresno State were and are food insecure.,Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Experience being a minority student,"A lot of those are probably undocumented because we have about 400 or 500 undocumented students. We still can't offer them Pell Grants until the DREAM Act is passed. So their financial situation is precarious. A lot of them were suffering in silence because they're the first in their families to go to college. They are the role models and they don't want to say to their parents, in fact their parents might be suffering more. So they suffer in silence. It was this thing, I mean this study has opened my eyes. Some of them were even dumpster diving and just scrounging around. It's like our students have to do that is just so painful to understand and believe.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Faculty,"Early on in high school I wanted to focus on leadership and public service but it wasn't until I became a student at Berkeley where I really understood the impact that universities can have on peoples' lives, the transformational impact. So for me serving in a university became kind of a focus of my career as a professor and administrator and how as President. It's deeply meaningful to be here at this time. There's just been an incredible about of support from the community for what we're trying to do.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Faculty,completely new cabinet. The one that my predecessor had was together for the most part for ten years and very talented folks. A lot of them were scheduled for retirement so it gave me the chance to search. We have appointed our top choice in every search for candidates. Most of them we now have a majority of cabinet members who graduate from this institution.,Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Faculty,"the Provost has, our Vice President for Advancement, our Vice President for Administration, my Chief of Staff, our Communications Vice President. They all graduated from here. All but one of them grew up here. So it's got a really distinct flavor of local people and that's important to me because there's this message that goes out across this region from businesses and some public entities that it's very difficult to attract talent.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Faculty,"I'm actually really lucky in that regard because most people in the education program only work with credential and master students and then some people work also with our doctoral program. I get to work with incoming freshman. I teach an academic literacy course that I started teaching when I was still adjunct. It's a cohorted model called First Year Experience for 100 students each year. They are the most at risk students on our campus. Every student in this cohort is first generation. Every student in this cohort has met minimum requirements to attend this university but has failed both English and math placement exams. So if they don't remediate within that first year they're not allowed to stay. I get to teach one of their only GE courses that year. Academic reading is a special designation course that they get GE credit for. I get to work with 100 freshmen, 18 year olds, first time, first generation freshmen every year. So I really get to know more about the campus culture than a lot of people but I also work with credential students and grad students in my more typically literacy courses.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Faculty,"your relationship with your colleagues here in your area and just kind of like the way that you work together in order to achieve the goals with regard to teacher education.  I think it's a pretty congenial group of people in general. Everybody seems very friendly and everybody gets along but there are definitely pockets of people who are active and who are working, are here every day and are working on multiple, have three or four balls in the air at all times and who really are doing the hard work of wanting to affect change. Then there are the others who will smile at you in the hallway but are also kind of reveling in the fact that they teach their three courses and have lots of free time because they published their three articles that they needed for tenure and they're never going to lift a pen again or write another word. There are faculty here who stay current and who are going to AERA and other major conferences every year and are publishing and are researching their own practice. Then there are others who have not even read any research for the past 10 to 15 years.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Faculty,"I have found my little niche of likeminded people and every day is exciting because we're always doing something. Last week I was working with a colleague friend who is on the liberal studies grant with me. We were visiting all of the department chairs of all of the content areas engaged in the world studies all across campus. So we got to take all of these fabulous walks and meet all these people. We were telling them about the grant and the work we're doing and inviting them to participate and offering them money. It was this very exciting moment where we were making these kinds of connections. Kathy and I used this monitor to collaborate in writing. Much of the grant we wrote for you was written on this TV screen with Google Docs. -0:10:07- Kathy Louda and I are working on another study of the childcare center downstairs and how translanguaging is a perfect fit for the Reggio Emilia Approach to preschool. We've submitted both an article and a LRA proposal. So I think there's like this really vibrant little group of us who are just, again, I think we all see the same thing which is anything we can want to happen or imagine happening we can make happen. There's no one stopping us and there's tons of support from our Dean. It's just a matter of the work that you're willing to put in.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Faculty,"I love coming to work every single day. I don't think I ever loved anything as much as I love this job in my adult life of work and school. I mean I love teaching but this is so, every day is so exciting and it's not the same ever. In that sense I feel really lucky.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Faculty,"There is a faculty member who runs the liberal studies, what do we call them, the liberal studies meetings twice a month. Liberal studies team? No. I don't know what they're called. Anyway, she runs the liberal studies, she's the liaison to all of these people. She has been sort of a push back person since our other grant started or since the planning stages of this other grant saying that the liberal studies committee or the people on it are not going to want to participate. They don't want to do anything, they're naysayers, you're not going to win them over. Then she's told us we can't cohort students. Students in a cohort doesn't work in a model. She's just put up all of these barriers and blamed all of the barriers on all of these other people. We've managed to talk to all of these people and find out that they're actually really excited. The advisors would love to cohort people because it would be easier for everybody and the students would not have to worry about enrolling in classes.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Faculty,"The faculty want the opportunity and the time and the space to unpack Common Core, the CSET standards and figure out what their syllabi, how they're missing the mark because we do have a really severe issue with our students not meeting the high stakes barriers and not being able to continue or complete their credentials. But I think a little bit of perseverance and not taking no for an answer has been one way. But I think that's only one example because I think in other ways sometimes you can finesse it without having to do a little steamrolling. There are people who have been here a long time who are not necessarily going to want to look at their syllabi and rethink them. There are people on campus who are not going to want to add current research to their research courses. I'm not going to be able to steamroll everyone because I'm not in charge of the world. I'm not the king of this school. So I think in those cases sometimes it's just going to be ongoing dialog and conversation and sometimes ongoing conversations that aren't fun or comfortable to have but that need to be had, need to be done.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Future Plans,"Oh, absolutely. The Southeast Asian population is very important and a growing population. I believe that we have one of the largest percentages of Hmong students in the nation. They came here for political reasons. Many of them have gone into agriculture, the parents have. I'd like to position our college so that we serve a greater diversity of students including more Southeast Asian students and look at different kinds of crops. I think there is lots of potential in that area. We have a 1,000 acre farm where we can do a lot of that experimentation. For example, they weren't growing jalapeno peppers and it's like why wouldn't we do that in Fresno with the population that we have.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Future Plans,"Well, for me I think conceptually I want everyone here and our 200,000 alumni, 80% of whom live in this region. We have 160,000 alumni right here. So as I travel around to every city in our region they're the mayors and they're the doctors, they're the teachers, they're the professors in the local community colleges or the teachers in the schools and so forth. So I want us all to be on the same page that this institution is about transforming the lives of the students who come here and to position them for the changes that are occurring out in our society in the workforce. So it's all about making sure that they don't just arrive. There hasn't been a huge emphasis on access and I love that. I want to preserve that. There had not been as much of an intentional focus on that person and their experience here and their roadmap to success. I believe that now we have that intentional focus and it's supported at the highest level by our Board of Trustees and by Chancellor White. We have targets for graduation rates and programs and plans but it goes beyond that. It goes to the heart of how we organize our work, so how we schedule classes, how we advise our students, whether we have recreational spaces here. In the past there had been the emphasis was we go to the local high school and play club sports instead of stay here. So it's an emphasis on making sure that every student thrives and that they feel comfortable here and that they spend as much time here. It's not oh I've got to go there for two hours for a class and then running somewhere else whether it's a job or some other obligation. I want to do whatever we can to keep them here for as much as they can be here realizing they have different obligations but making this a place where if you walk through the library at the noon hour you'll see hundreds and hundreds of students and at 5:00 the same. This place is a beehive of activity. Outside not so much. We have a lot of nice days here and I'd love to make the whole campus part of the learning experience in ways that it hasn't so far. With technology you can do that. So that's what I'm thinking about at that highest level. Yes, I think it will translate into higher graduation rates. I actually think the 70% rate that we've set for the next ten years I think, between us, we're going to climb over that much soon just the way we've been climbing. I think we'll climb over it faster.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Future Plans,"At the end of my first year last year was 52 and they tell me that it will probably be about 55 or so. Some of the faculty feel like I'm pushing this too hard but I'm going to keep pushing because I think that it's that intentionality that it's not just I'm going to get to meet this student and nice having them on campus for a few years. This system, our system was actually built around losing half of our students. The financial formula, the enrollment formula, all of that and if you look at the line, the graduation rate over say the 15 years before it was essentially flat lined around 49% or 50%. So I think that we can change that dramatically. The other effect of doing that is that we'll attract students from all backgrounds, including the children of our alumni. I found that some of our alumni were sending their children elsewhere because they felt like they weren't going to get a quality experience like they may have had when they came.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Future Plans,"Messaging and everybody, I want this to be a destination university for students from all backgrounds. I think that that message is resonating with a lot of parents who are seeing that we're investing more in the success of our students. We're positioning ourselves more as being engaged with technology. We were just at Apple last week talking about some new ways to partner around our DISCOVERe tablet initiative. Have they shared with you anything about that initiative?",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Future Plans,Yes. Northridge rolled one out a year before us and we learned a lot from them. They decided that they were going to focus in on juniors in certain fields. When we looked at that we decided it would be better for us to go campus wide. So every college in school is involved in it and has faculty in the program. Then we went undergrad and grad as well. It's possible that in a later stage we might look at some groupings by year but for right now we actually had the faculty self-identity. So if that faculty member was teaching a course then that would become a tablet course and then we're going to scale it from there. It's worked out. I think for us it was the right cultural move because it enabled them to be empowered to say I want to get in on that,Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Inspiration,"Early on in high school I wanted to focus on leadership and public service but it wasn't until I became a student at Berkeley where I really understood the impact that universities can have on peoples' lives, the transformational impact.

There's just been an incredible about of support from the community for what we're trying to do.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Recruitment,"By next year, because of demand, that will mean that no one from outside the area regardless of their GPA could get in. So I've now begun conversations with them and we're having town halls about how we change this because it's an unsustainable path. It would mean that young people who share the diverse background of our students who might live just outside the boundaries of the four counties who want to study agriculture or engineering...",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Recruitment,"raise the requirements for the four county students and a small number, 400 or 500 of those, would no longer be admitted here. That would leave some room for those from outside the four county service area who meet higher levels of requirements to continue to have access. But then the implications for that are we've got to make sure that parents and students understand the changes and they can go to a community college.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Reflection,"When I interviewed for the job I observed that my first seven, the first seven Presidents while they were all very distinguished none of them were born in California nor in this area. I grew up just 40 miles from the campus. My grandparents immigrated here from Mexico. My great grandfather helped to build the railroad through the San Joaquin Valley and my grandfather who raised me ended up residing in Hanford which is in Kings County. I went away to college at Berkeley and at Stanford and I served in the UC system for about 23 years. About a year before I became President I decided I wanted to try to be a President because for me it kind of brought everything together. Early on in high school I wanted to focus on leadership and public service but it wasn't until I became a student at Berkeley where I really understood the impact that universities can have on peoples' lives, the transformational impact. So for me serving in a university became kind of a focus of my career as a professor and administrator and how as President. It's deeply meaningful to be here at this time. There's just been an incredible about of support from the community for what we're trying to do.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Resources,Hopefully you'll hear more. We just rolled that out in the fall and that initiative again is about student success but it's also about understanding the changes in technology. So we're moving for them from textbooks to the tablet. Some professors are beginning to customize their own materials. What we've seen is a much higher level of engagement by the students and the faculty in these redesigned courses. We've lower textbook costs by 55%. Actually at Apple last week we had some very interesting conversations about student learning and changing the way in which textbooks are created. They were urging us to have the students in the course write the textbook with the faculty member for the next course. They have found that students who are engaged in that way do better.,Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Resources,"That's what we're finding, giving them the tools and we've invested a lot in faculty development so that they could redesign their courses, so they know about resources that they could use.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Resources,"Absolutely. Earlier in my career I had served here as part of the UC Merced campus and worked with a lot of the educators here and Fresno State folks Fresno State has very long term relationships with districts that go beyond individual superintendents and principals. We've been here a hundred years so over that period some really great institutional relationships have been developed. I think that's one of the secrets of the success here. The other is having those strong leaders in different positions whether it's superintendents or school board members, active teachers. I think because so many of them are our alumni that that has really helped to solidify the connections and those alumni have had good experiences because if they had negative experiences it would have been harder. We find ways to stay connected with them. So in a few days I'll be in a room. I was last week in a room with all the Fresno County K-12 superintendents and I'll be in a room again with many of them next week. So there are groupings that get together on a regular basis. The superintendent of Fresno Unified he and I talk almost every day about something and I know the Dean does as well. So those connections are very strong. I think that as we focus even more on success I think we'll find that even more students will want to come here and study whether it's in the credentialing program or other fields that we have across the campus. So I think you'll see those programs becoming stronger and stronger over time.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Resources,"They couldn't come. So I think what we're going to do, we're still having discussions is we're going to raise the requirements for the four county students and a small number, 400 or 500 of those, would no longer be admitted here. That would leave some room for those from outside the four county service area who meet higher levels of requirements to continue to have access. But then the implications for that are we've got to make sure that parents and students understand the changes and they can go to a community college. We're keeping that path the same so that in two years they can come to see us. But it's that intentional focus together on what are the issues, what are the decisions that we have to make together and how can we help each other retrain the teachers that are working with them to prepare the students to come here. So we're implicated in so many ways and I'm well aware that in the past, not necessarily here but across the nation, university presidents and others will say to K-12 do a better job and prepare those students better but it's really all of us together. I've never believed in that approach. I don't think it's a very productive line. I think it's more about how do we focus together on a success even if preschool students all the way through higher education. So how do we support Head Start and First 5 efforts here and that sort of thing so that we're all a part of one team. I think that's helped a lot.",Faculty/Admin,man
ID13,Resources,"They miss one or two meals a day. They were clearly, it was impacting everything. So we rolled out an initiative beginning last fall and we were just talking at cabinet this morning.

They get guidance and advising on, they have to select within liberal studies is a wide array of courses and then they have to pick an emphasis area and they have to take a nine unit segment of classes that follow a continuum within one area.",Faculty/Admin,woman
ID16,Challenges,"There is a faculty member who runs the liberal studies, what do we call them, the liberal studies meetings twice a month. Liberal studies team? No. I don't know what they're called. Anyway, she runs the liberal studies, she's the liaison to all of these people. She has been sort of a push back person since our other grant started or since the planning stages of this other grant saying that the liberal studies committee or the people on it are not going to want to participate. They don't want to do anything, they're naysayers, you're not going to win them over. Then she's told us we can't cohort students. Students in a cohort doesn't work in a model. She's just put up all of these barriers and blamed all of the barriers on all of these other people. We've managed to talk to all of these people and find out that they're actually really excited. The advisors would love to cohort people because it would be easier for everybody and the students would not have to worry about enrolling in classes.",Faculty/Admin,woman
ID16,Challenges,"The faculty want the opportunity and the time and the space to unpack Common Core, the CSET standards and figure out what their syllabi, how they're missing the mark because we do have a really severe issue with our students not meeting the high stakes barriers and not being able to continue or complete their credentials. But I think a little bit of perseverance and not taking no for an answer has been one way. But I think that's only one example because I think in other ways sometimes you can finesse it without having to do a little steamrolling. There are people who have been here a long time who are not necessarily going to want to look at their syllabi and rethink them. There are people on campus who are not going to want to add current research to their research courses. I'm not going to be able to steamroll everyone because I'm not in charge of the world. I'm not the king of this school. So I think in those cases sometimes it's just going to be ongoing dialog and conversation and sometimes ongoing conversations that aren't fun or comfortable to have but that need to be had, need to be done.",Faculty/Admin,woman
ID16,Challenges,"Most of our liberal studies students if they set foot in a classroom once before they go into their, before they enter the credential program they have to do Ed 50 which is, what, 50 or 60 hours of observation and participation in a classroom, which they typically do in their last semester. But prior to that requirement for entry into the program we have probably the greatest percentage of our students who are never in a classroom setting and who don't have field experience and don't have service learning and aren't looking at teaching as transformation. They're looking at it as a job. In fact I would say if there's one thing I can do before I retire and stop doing anything it would be to have a larger percentage of students understand teaching as a transformative event. That's why I left the classroom because I could only do that in my own space rather than making that happen on a larger scale.",Faculty/Admin,woman
ID16,Challenges,"So what we think in terms of CSET is, yes, they need test prep and there is a lot of talk about test prep and there's a lot of talk about understanding, unpacking it and understanding the content and doing the test practices and all of this other stuff that makes my toes curl. But what we really want them to do is step back from the test one step and understand that it is a barrier and understand historically what this means on a great context and understand what does it mean that the faculty in your liberal studies program who taught the course that was supposed to prepare you for this don't even know what's on that test. Sometimes in order to really make change and be transformative you've got to sort of rally everybody and insight a little bit of frustration about the status quo. The status quo in our opinion is not addressing these needs in a mindful way, in a multitude of context.

We want our students who ultimately pass CSET to say hey this is a lot like what students in my classroom will face when the high stakes standardized testing comes through.

So I feel like it's not just me going in with my way of being in the classroom but it's like there's a give and take there. I run into students in the community all the time who will talk about something that changed their lives.

So they all have a shared vision and a shared experience. They all come in some way from migrant backgrounds and they all have had experiences in schooling that have been either gatekeeping or people looking at them through a deficit lens. So they've had experiences that they can connect to their own desire to make that not be the case for the next generation of learners. They have the ability that virtually no one else has to connect with children and their families in their homes and their lives in a way that is not top down or condescending.

So I feel like it's not just me going in with my way of being in the classroom but it's like there's a give and take there. I run into students in the community all the time who will talk about something that changed their lives. I just feel like there's a recognition of the effort to make this more of a community of practice rather than this top down infrastructure of me being the sage or the person in charge.,Faculty/Admin,woman
ID16,Support System,"Our students are really, I mean I give students my number and they will call me. They will email me if they have issues that are sometimes even unrelated to the course work. I just feel like that some things that, I don't know that that happens everywhere but it feels like the right way to make things happen here",Faculty/Admin,woman
ID16,Support System,"Students are in some ways really struggling. We have a lot of food insecure students. We have a lot of students who have children before entering college. We have students with major issues on their plate and a lot of responsibility. They're not the kind of college students who have someone paying for them to go to school for four years and focus on students. They are students who are working their way through and who often have a job and are struggling to get childcare and in some cases struggling, choosing between the textbook and a meal. They are amazing. I mean they are so dedicated and they're so excited by that opportunity. They're willing to do that hard work and they're just amazing.",Faculty/Admin,woman
ID16,Support System,"I have found my little niche of likeminded people and every day is exciting because we're always doing something. Last week I was working with a colleague friend who is on the liberal studies grant with me. We were visiting all of the department chairs of all of the content areas engaged in the world studies all across campus. So we got to take all of these fabulous walks and meet all these people. We were telling them about the grant and the work we're doing and inviting them to participate and offering them money. It was this very exciting moment where we were making these kinds of connections. Kathy and I used this monitor to collaborate in writing. Much of the grant we wrote for you was written on this TV screen with Google Docs. -0:10:07- Kathy Louda and I are working on another study of the childcare center downstairs and how translanguaging is a perfect fit for the Reggio Emilia Approach to preschool. We've submitted both an article and a LRA proposal. So I think there's like this really vibrant little group of us who are just, again, I think we all see the same thing which is anything we can want to happen or imagine happening we can make happen. There's no one stopping us and there's tons of support from our Dean. It's just a matter of the work that you're willing to put in.",Faculty/Admin,woman
ID16,Support System,"Mini corps is probably the single most amazing entity we have within teacher ed because it's so, not just comprehensive but homegrown. So the people, the students who are in mini corps are working with faculty who once were mini corps who are working with teachers in the community who were once mini corps. So they all have a shared vision and a shared experience. They all come in some way from migrant backgrounds and they all have had experiences in schooling that have been either gatekeeping or people looking at them through a deficit lens. So they've had experiences that they can connect to their own desire to make that not be the case for the next generation of learners. They have the ability that virtually no one else has to connect with children and their families in their homes and their lives in a way that is not top down or condescending. They can talk about their own experience and how the experience that they had had led them to this place in their lives where they're now college students looking at careers in education. It's more valid coming from these students. I mean it's believable, it's real, it's like grassroots change at the very finest.",Faculty/Admin,woman
ID16,Support System,"Room 100 downstairs. It's the advising office. They're told of all of the different opportunities that we have for students in liberal studies. We have another group called teaching fellows which is a much, much lighter version of the mini corps in terms of how much time the students spend in classroom settings and how much scaffolding and support they get in those roles. But they do get some extended education in literacy development and then they go out and provide tutoring services. So it's not to the same degree but they do have another, this is another opportunity that they can have. We have Build a Teacher Club, we have different courses they can take. They get guidance and advising on, they have to select within liberal studies is a wide array of courses and then they have to pick an emphasis area and they have to take a nine unit segment of classes that follow a continuum within one area.",Faculty/Admin,woman
ID16,Support System,We do have some knowledge and some expertise in some areas. It's not all encompassing but we'd love to share it. But we also are trying at our own level to get a greater understanding of what Jose and Lilly see as strengths and what they see as the areas of need in their own program. We aren't there but we do also in the back of our minds know and Louda is currently the coordinator and I'll be taking over next year in that role that we have a gate and we have students bashing up against it and not getting through it.,Faculty/Admin,woman
ID16,Support System,"So what we think in terms of CSET is, yes, they need test prep and there is a lot of talk about test prep and there's a lot of talk about understanding, unpacking it and understanding the content and doing the test practices and all of this other stuff that makes my toes curl. But what we really want them to do is step back from the test one step and understand that it is a barrier and understand historically what this means on a great context and understand what does it mean that the faculty in your liberal studies program who taught the course that was supposed to prepare you for this don't even know what's on that test. Sometimes in order to really make change and be transformative you've got to sort of rally everybody and insight a little bit of frustration about the status quo. The status quo in our opinion is not addressing these needs in a mindful way, in a multitude of context. So our role is we're not just lighting a fire under the mini corps students and telling them hey this kind of blows that they didn't prepare you but we're now also working with all of our liberal studies faculty to ask them the difficult questions.",Faculty/Admin,woman
ID16,Support System,"we're trying to work in all of these different spheres with the ultimate goal of, yes, this sort of pragmatic gatekeeping device but we don't want to stop there. We don't want to be just go take your test prep course and then you'll be okay and then you can move on with your life and with your job. We want our students who ultimately pass CSET to say hey this is a lot like what students in my classroom will face when the high stakes standardized testing comes through. I'm making decisions about teaching what I know is right versus teaching what I know is on the test and how am I going to walk that tightrope so that my students both have access to the culture of power but also have the ability to resist and to work around it and outside of it.",Faculty/Admin,woman

They could pull the plug at any time when you're going on programs, which comes back to the teacher ed program and where I got started. Unfortunately the Department of Ed so chose to pull that program. So all of the people in that that came through and obtained their degrees and were teaching in the schools, teaching by far and away most of them.

So we worked hard and eventually it came through shortly before I left the college as president, which was 2004. I don't think we had it when we left.

What we did was is we went back and we used the HBCU's an example of what they did, how they used it and how they got what they wanted. Saying, okay, you already set the precedent here. Let's see what we can do. So what they did was, which is typically what they did with the HBCU's too, was is that they opened up their Title III, their Strengthening Institutions Grants. That's where we got our construction dollars. The rest is history. We got it all taken care of but that's kind of where we started.

Of course having Indian Health Service and their lack of oversight is allowing for an awful lot of drugs to hit the street that otherwise shouldn't. So they're taking full advantage of it. Prescription medicine is another one they can easily explain to their employer. Marijuana or cocaine or anything else, crack. That's kind of hard to explain.

It's a very diverse classroom. There's only like five at level. It's more like a Special Ed but I feel like that's, I feel prepared now. Not prepared but I feel like because I can talk to a classroom and oh no we don't have an IEP here in Las Cruces. So I feel like that's why I got placed there. I mean one of the things that I probably would suggest for people that they put outside of the thing is well because of my finances and just helping us with the financials to like drive over there and come back. It's really good that NMSU is placing teachers outside of the community, not just in this community, because you learn a lot from them.",Student,woman
ID4,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,"The outcome you get from it. For example, an experience with one of the kids that I had, he's ADHD and speech. When I walked into the classroom he was walking everywhere, everywhere, like everywhere. I was like oh my God sit down. Sit down, please. All the teachers were like when I would get him to do something the teachers there would be like, no, it's okay Miss Reyes. That's the most he's ever done. Or they would not expect from him and I did not want to give up on him. Just the joy that he's one of my students that I'm doing my individualized stream portfolio on. He is like one of the smartest kids in there. Just the outcome that like you get like I worked with him and he could do it and I could prove a lot of teachers, I proved a lot of teachers there and they're amazed. Just the outcome you get from the student learning.",Student,woman
ID4,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,"show him that personal connection that I really care for him. I did a lot of ones on ones, one on one and lot of more just at school and connect like what did you do this weekend and so and so like his name and just connect to his background knowledge. Now his mom, I never heard that what the teacher told me that his mom never showed up in school. She shows up to school and if he forgets his homework he'll call her to bring his homework. This is one of the kids that had never brought his homework like in the past. Now he's like Miss I brought my homework. Good job.",Student,woman
ID4,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,Now they're like he did his homework. They acknowledge him. They see him more as a person for who he is. I don't really care too much about the acknowledgement but they do to him. So that's my acknowledgement that they see his work and what he's capable to of doing.,Student,woman
ID4,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,"I wish we could have had more hands on. Honestly, just having teaching time. Just the testing, of course, and I see my kids crying in the class because they don't want to do it and just trying to implement the wonderful ideas we've learned at the university and just trying to just stick to the district's curriculum. That's the hardest challenge that I have. Getting to do this for the unit test and I'm like where are the wonderful like all of the things that we learned to do because we have learned so many things here. I'm integrating like the Fount of Knowledge and doing home visits and creating lesson plans based on that. So I think one of the hardest things is just implementing, like having time to teach those things.",Student,woman
ID4,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,"the unit test, the grade level test, today I did a Jeopardy game. So I try to do fun stuff out of that. If they get a good grade I try to reward them. So I try to see the positive for them to see because it feeds off from me if I stress and they feed it like I feed it to them. I just try to do like fun activities. If you guys get a good grade you know we're going to do this or just rewards a lot. So like a lot of rewards so that's how.",Student,woman
ID4,Experience being a minority student,"n math because I was placed like in pre calc and calculus when I was a junior and senior. It's just that the teacher didn't help me a lot I felt. It was a lot of, I was like one of the only minority kids in there so it was very difficult. It was like seven years ago. It was very hard for me to get help. I feel like I was competent now that I think and go back. I just didn't have the support. So that's what pushed me from high school math because you have to take a lot of math. But now that I did the elementary I love it. I'm just having that math as a strain to teach math because we need a little math in elementary and just in case I ever go to the middle school level.",Student,woman
ID4,Future Plans,"F: I already have a letter of intent in the district. So I'll be teaching. I want to teach. I want to go out there and have the experience and hopefully soon go for my masters. I'm not sure, still in teaching but my long term goal is to teach other teachers.",Student,woman
ID4,Future Plans,"F: One of them right now like I was talking to Dr. -0:23:50- because she was just telling me, I was just talking to her and I was just telling her I just hope to accomplish a Ph.D. one day. I guess when I was in high school it was a bachelors and now it's just my long term is achieving a Ph.D. because as a Hispanic student it's just something I really want to do.",Student,woman
ID4,Inspiration,"So I'm from here, from Las Cruces. I became interested in teaching ever since I was small like playing with my little brothers and being the teacher. I always envisioned myself being a teacher growing up. I always told my parents I wanted to be a teacher but then I was like oh teachers don't get paid really well so I was like I changed my mind and I was like I want to do something different. But my heart was always in teaching because I had been an instructor for -0:02:26-, the ones that dance with the colorful dresses. I love to teach.",Student,woman
ID4,Inspiration,"F: When they give me the letter for Hatch, because I was really expecting a school here so I could still keep more hours and just stuff. I was like really disappointed. I was like why me because Hatch is like 45 minutes away. I don't know, it's just the drive and I needed to cut my hours. I was really disappointed. I remember writing her an email like I can't go and really just can't car pool and it's not going to work for me. But then I thought about it like, oh my God, like if I was placed in Hatch it was for a reason. So the first day that I walked into the classroom I just wanted to cry because it's a rural community, a very small community.

ID4,Inspiration,"Actually I do at the elementary level. I actually went back to one of her classrooms. She retired. She was a bilingual teacher. She influenced me a lot. I was a very shy kid in school so I don't know I guess she seen my strength and helped me a lot. I have another high school teacher that I plan to go back to because she pushed me a lot too. High school is really hard. She would only give scholarships. Honestly I admire, it's not like bias but I admire a lot of Hispanic and any Hispanic instructors.",Student,woman
ID4,Inspiration,"F Yes, women. That would be one of the things and I also want to be that to my students. A lot of teachers influenced me to be a teacher because I want to help especially a lot of kids that came from my background because I had a hard background. Especially in this area you see a lot of immigrants and bilingual kids. It's really hard right now. A lot of kids right now in my school their parents are facing deportation or they spend their weekends in Mexico. I know where they're coming from and that's like my target would be out there and then of course hopefully become a professor one time. That's one of the things that I want to do. I hope.",Student,woman
ID4,Inspiration,"I was here on a student visa and it made more sense for me to continue being a student. I also think that when people have an opportunity to teach, for example, to do something else instead of just being a student then that can really enrich the way in which they approach doing the doctorate. It sounds like you've really planned out a trajectory.",Student,woman
ID4,Mentorship,"My first block was the first grade classroom in a bilingual. They were both bilingual. Yes, I did. I really liked the structure. It was a really good connection. She helped me a lot. When I went to my fourth grade it was a male and it's kind of, I don't know, it's kind of hard for me, I don't know. I really wanted to teach in upper grades because I've always wanted to teach the upper grades. So I guess it was just the connection it was just difference of genders. I think a female teacher is different from a male but I still learned from him. I made more of a connection with my female teacher than with my male.",Student,woman

ID4,Pedagogy,"What did I do? I did what other teachers didn't do. I rewarded him by drawing like every time he did something or I used a lot of hands on, so a lot of rewards for him and of course showing him that I cared. I guess his previous teachers didn't.",Student,woman
ID4,Pedagogy,"I: How did you show him that you care? : How I show him that I care is like in Spanish like you know if you bring your homework you're going to do this or you know this is kind of like me doing this is kind of your, because teachers were not getting too upset with me. Like if you don't do this I really care for your learning and you know if you're not doing this you know I get a bad grade too. Like show him that personal connection that I really care for him. I did a lot of ones on ones, one on one and lot of more just at school and connect like what did you do this weekend and so and so like his name and just connect to his background knowledge.

ID4,Standardized Testing,F: My greatest concern right now would be just being effective as a teacher to help the students with all the tests and prepare them because they are hard. Right now I am in third grade so it's their first year taking the test. So I see my teacher working very hard to help them and kind of guide them. So I think that would be my issue of concern how to help them.,Student,woman
ID4,Support System,"F: No, he's not but I guess we've been together for like six years and so he's been very supportive with my education. I had to give up a job so he's been supporting me financially. I had some scholarships but he's been good.",Student,woman
ID5,Challenges,"I'm not sure. I'm not sure honestly. When I joke with my brothers about it I tell them that being a teacher, in my opinion, is probably one of the hardest jobs ever because of everything that it entails. I feel being a teacher is not ever just being a teacher. You have to fill so many different roles while you're there. You could possibly be a mom, possibly be a dad or confidant or a person to give the students a little love or even respect. On top of that you have to get different information locked into their heads, math, reading, language arts, science all while doing all of these other things that I've already stated. Even just to refer back to my internship at Clemson, it will take a toll. We call it the look of death and we joked about it. But almost every day when we got done with working like we would just on the bus and everybody would be quiet. This is a full bus mind you, just drive on back to campus, get back on campus and just go to sleep. It really takes it out of you.",Student,man
ID5,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,"A good teacher would be a successful transfer of accurate knowledge between the students, from me to the students. I feel like that's a good way to determine. That's one reason the teacher, well not the only reason, but a main reason the teacher is there to help give them knowledge so they can learn and be able to do more with the knowledge that they're given. I feel if you can spit something out to them and they can spit it right back out and it still lines up correctly then I would believe that that's a job well done. I also think it takes time. During the internship that's what my supervisor was sure to tell me about. It just takes time. I kept asking questions as to how to work with this type of personality or this type of student or this behavior. They were telling me that a lot of things I was asking about is really a learning process versus a moment.",Student,man
ID5,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,"M: Yes. I think that's a piece of it. I'm not going to say that because I'm an African American male that that's all there is to it.

ID5,Experience being a minority teacher,"During all throughout the process I kept having these realizations because I've been accustomed to being a student. To stand up in front of a classroom with nobody else just you in front of a classroom and you're the teacher now it was a shock. It was a shock. So I had to keep my mind rolling because I would like to dwell on it for a little bit longer to just really let it soak in. The children, the students, I won't call them children. The students are right in front of you. You don't have time to try to process that because they're waiting on you. That was just different all together.",Student,man
ID5,Experience being a minority teacher,"having an African American male in the classroom I'm going to call it a rare sight. Maybe since so many children only have that one experience it molds, like they build and add to that image whether it's good or bad about that teacher, about other African American male teachers. If it was negative then they're adding to a negative image. If it was positive of course then vice versa.

ID5,Support System,"It means that I've accepted them as my brothers. In the program like the program has different tenets and one focus is being a brother's keeper. This is my second year being in the program. My first year I wasn't doing that well because I was about self-development, self-development and getting myself through the program, being able to not assert myself into a position but make myself seen so that I can continue to progress. Even though I was doing that and I can do it well I wasn't taking care to recognize my brothers. Because even though I was in a program with other members I was still an individual and that was how I looked at it. We are individuals under an umbrella, if you will. At this point as I've come to learn, learn and grow, I'm really taking steps to be more responsible like talking with them more and hanging out and really getting to know these other people in the program so that they're not other people.

In South Carolina there are cohorts from all over the country that come there that are Call Me MISTER. We all come back and gather together and get to meet and greet each other and you establish relationships that way. By the end of it like some of the seniors of the Call Me MISTER program they would just let me know that I also have to do what I can to encourage the program, to make it better than what it is, to make it better. I took up that charge. During that time we were speaking about it and that was what really pushed me to try to become president.

Our supervisors would take like little notes to let us know what they liked or what they didn't like and just pretty much tried to help us understand the different things that we could probably work on. But they were also like very liberal too. Call Me MISTER encourages you as a teacher to develop your uniqueness, that thing that's unique to you like why you're in the classroom because that will most definitely benefit you.",Student,man
ID5,Support System,"we're being a teacher for students, the members of Call Me MISTER, we're still also finding ourselves, trying to develop our own person and establish ourselves. That's probably a struggle because we have to be these things for our students but we also have to, we have to do something for ourselves as well.",Student,man
ID14,Challenges,"It's people who work, yes. It's normally for it to be flexible for them for people who work. So it was kind of like a mix of everything and then we were in an I-TV system. So there was different campuses like Alamogordo, Grants and Carlsbad. So that was kind of fun to see the others because it worked really well just to see them on screen. I felt a little lost because I felt like I wasn't at my level. We had a lot of discussions and conversations and I feel like I could bring in something to the conversation but then there was just people who have a lot of experience that I felt sometimes that I was like oh I haven't been in a classroom that much. There were some even that were already teachers but they just needed like their license. So I felt like I wasn't that, that I should be very professional when it came to all of this work that we had to do. The workload is a lot heavier definitely. I was very stressed last semester and this semester has been just fine. We were only five hours a week in the classroom, I guess. We had to complete just 50 hours for the semester.",Student,woman
ID14,Challenges,"I do. I think some of the biggest challenges are just, I've just heard a lot about standardized testing and all this I guess political kind of things going around education. So I think it's a challenge to just concentrate on doing what you do because you love it and just teaching from the heart. I'm obviously following the curriculum but not, teachers are kind of stressed taking all of the external factors that are going around and I think the essence of what teaching is and teaching at this school for example I feel a lot of the kids come from families that might be a little problematic or a little broken up. So I really like to take in all that more into my teaching as well because kids don't have it at home. So just taking into account all of those differences and we learned a lot about diversity and all these things that you have to take into account. So I think the challenge is just to kind of like teach the essentials and taking in all that diversity and all the needs of your students instead of all the external factors that might stray away from the essentials.",Student,woman
ID14,Classroom Environment,"Time passes so quick because I'm always doing something. You're not just sitting there. I can always feel free to walk around the kids. They're always set in groups and you always know which are the groups who are struggling and you sit down with a teacher and she lets you know okay I need you to focus on these kids and he's having trouble with this math and this. So it's kind of like, there's three teachers in that classroom and there's only like 14 students. So we kind of rotate. I feel like I'm always doing something. Even if I'm not teaching I'll always be with a group and walking around and helping and clearing things up. It's a bilingual class or I'm in a Spanish one.",Student,woman
ID14,Classroom Environment,I really like teaching in my language. I had never done it before and I have the opportunity here and I love it because I can help those students who are struggling with both languages and you can just do a lot of things. It's great being in the classroom. You're always active.,Student,woman
ID14,Classroom Environment,"I haven't heard it mentioned in the seminars since we only have it once a week. We kind of just concentrate, it's a two hour seminar it's like okay whatever our subject is we target that and that's all we concentrate. But in the evening block since we had a lot more time for discussion topics always came up. We would be there probably for an hour talking about all the norms and the governor and this and education. It's like a whole other thing. We talk a lot about it but it really doesn't get us anywhere. We just complain. I mean I don't really complain because I don't really know what it's about to tell you the truth. I don't feel like I'm prepared to just complain about things. I need to be more informed. But I know there was just a lot of complaining and arguing and stuff about it. Here with my teacher she tells us a lot about what's going on like oh did you hear they're going to do like a strike or kind of like a march for the PARCC test which they're doing now and things like that.",Student,woman
ID14,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,"F: So I've kind of had a different experience because my first block was the evening so I didn't have a lot of time in the classroom. I was only there once a week. So this semester has been great. I was very lucky to have an awesome teacher. She knows a lot. She has a lot of experience and she's willing to help us because I'm with another student and we're kind of co-teaching so it's two of us in the classroom. It's a small class and I thought it was kind of, I didn't know why they put two of us there. Maybe because last semester I was in a class with 30 students and it was me alone. But it's been going great.",Student,woman
ID14,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,"I'm in fourth grade. At first I was placed in kinder and I was so excited. I was ready for it. I just walk in the classroom and I fall in love with the students and then they changed me because they didn't know I was bilingual because I'm not taking the bilingual endorsement. But then they asked me do you Spanish and I'm like yeah it's kind of like my first language. So they were like oh we need you in another class. So that was like oh okay because last year I was in fifth grade. But it's been going really well. I feel like I've been doing a lot, I've been teaching a lot and I was actually commenting with some of the students that I like this semester a lot better because the teachers seem to be more laid back. They are doing testing but they are reviewing a lot. So I told her I need to do this lesson for this class and she's like any topic you want. I have this list. They need a review on everything. You choose whatever you want, whatever book, very flexible. I feel like if I would have been here last semester it would have been like okay we need to be on task to finish everything on time. So right now it's kind of just like a review of the whole year. So they're very flexible and I really like it. The teacher lets us do a lot. She just so confident that we're kind of ready, I guess. I really like that. They just throw us to the sharks like okay go ahead and teach. So I'm really enjoying the practicum experience. I feel like I have done a lot in the classroom this semester.",Student,woman
ID14,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,"F: Sure. I got into the evening block because I registered late and I got into the education program late. So they kind of like okay just put me in there. There wasn't any spots in the on-site. The classes are in the evening. They're from, it's like a 2 ½ hour seminar and it works like this kind of like where we have four seminars and the evening one works once a week and here it's once a month for each seminar. It's mostly students, for me it was a little difficult because I feel like I'm young kind of. I'm starting college and there was a lot of like there were some masters students and there was a lot of parents.",Student,woman

ID14,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,"That was pretty flexible. You can choose whenever you wanted and I always chose to go on Thursdays like all morning. That would work for me because I worked all the other days. So that was a little hard because I only got whatever that teacher was doing on Thursdays, say it was only math for the morning and that was it. Here I've gotten a little bit of everything and maybe if she doesn't do science by the time I get here she'll say oh do science one morning so you guys can have a little taste of that. So I feel like I didn't get such a broad spectrum on all the subjects. We mostly did math when I was there. You don't get to teach a lot. I felt like I was observing most of the time. The teacher I got she was very good and she taught me a lot and she helped me a lot but I felt like it was more observation even if it was still a practicum. The evening classes the teachers were great and a lot of the things I learned I've been applying here. So I really like that. But I would definitely prefer the on-site but if it's convenient for others to take that evening block then I guess it just depends on each person. Since I didn't have a lot of experience in the classroom I prefer this one but some of the others had already been in the classroom as substitute teachers and had all of that so it's kind of like a break for them. So I think it just depends on the level you're at.",Student,woman

ID14,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,This December I was in India and for a month I volunteered in Delhi at a school and Calcutta with The Sisters of Charity with people with disabilities. I studied abroad in Germany and in Italy and I traveled through all of Europe. When I did my volunteer right after high school I was working a year in Rhode Island at a boarding school. I was a dean of discipline and it was like a Catholic boarding school for all girls. Then I was in Mexico at another Catholic school.,Student,woman
ID14,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,"was working at a school and actually a lot of the things that I have learned here I could take there. It was not only to give my time but also leave something for them. I made them kind of a Common Core Standard thing that the kids should be learning at the grade level they're at. It was just a school in a slum area which is very informal. So it was not just getting my like if you can help us out with a curriculum or something and I just got, I didn't even take my laptop or anything over there. It was just like with what I had like my phone and I had been emailing the people from here because they're like from an NGO over there in India. So actually a lot of things that I've learned here I applied over there.",Student,woman

ID14,Inspiration,"I decided to study education because since I was little I just have that, not something with children but we kind of like attract each other and I just have a lot of patience. I have two younger siblings and I have a lot of cousins, big families in Mexico. So I've always been around children and I feel that I have a lot of patience especially with children with special needs. I just kind of have that need, that want to just help. So that's kind of like a little seed in my heart was like I want to be generous, I want to do something for others but that I can also have like a professional education. So I thought education was the way to go. I actually didn't go into it right after high school because I wasn't sure. I was also think like a lot of comments like education oh like that's really easy to be a teacher. Why don't you study biology or something else? So I kind of was like oh should I be a teacher or not, should I maybe do it as a second major maybe and study something else? So I volunteered for two years and I was volunteering at schools as a formation assistant for girls. That's when I started just loving education and loving being around kids and just teaching them, not only directly but also indirectly like values and stuff with the way I act, I guess. So that's when I decided to go into education.",Student,woman

ID14,Opportunities,"when I came in to NMSU like right after my freshman year I could study abroad right after you have a year here. So I went through a program through the study abroad office. I was away for seven months and that was great. Then I got a scholarship for that and just looked for financial aid and all that stuff. So it wasn't that hard. It's just a matter of wanting to do it and you can do it. Then for India last semester in December I also when through NMSU. It was a program called Aggies Go Global. They're actually apart from study abroad but it's like an organization that helps you do volunteer work abroad that does not pertain to any like they don't give you any credits for it but its whatever you're studying like for your subject area or your major. There's anything you can do so since I'm an education major I just went there and I'm like okay I want to do something with kids and education. You just look for a program that fits you and that's great. You can choose the date, you can choose whatever you want to do and in whatever part of the world and they'll pay for your airfare and a lot of the things. So it's just a matter of looking for it. A lot of people are like oh it's too expensive to go. You just need to look for things and I promise you that they're there. The opportunities are there. You just need to look for them. So that was an opportunity.",Student,woman
ID14,Support System,"this semester has helped me in that to just kind of talk with my teachers on the breaks where the kids have probably block which is like oh that's inconvenient. I won't get to be teaching but it's very convenient because the teacher always has something to tell us and help us out with. They're never hiding anything. They're just like okay this is how it's going to be, this is the reality.",Student,woman
ID17,Campus Environment,": It is really diverse. You see all kinds of students' faces, different languages. Going in the library you hear all of these people talking and it's not just English. Even the teachers you get the teachers with the accents so you obviously know they're not from necessarily here. Yeah, it's pretty diverse I would say.",Student,woman
ID17,Campus Environment,it's an amazing campus. It's just having that connection and communication with the people that you meet. At first I was a little intimidated. I came from a smaller campus which was Merced College to here. So I mean right off the bat I felt like oh this is kind of scary. But like I said my advisor from Merced College came here so then he was like you know go talk to them. They could probably help you find a job and here and there. They were all kind of like Latinos the people that he would mention so that made me feel comfortable in a way. It's very diverse. They make you feel comfortable and they're very helpful in the questions you have and just getting to know them is very good.,Student,woman
ID17,Challenges,"At first when I was starting I wasn't sure what to do specifically to get into the credential program and all those things. It was hard. I am the first in my family to get this far in education so I had no guidance. But with everyone here helping you with all those, finding those classes and those resources I think those issues have kind of become clear",Student,woman
ID17,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,"it's really rewarding. The first year that I worked at the middle school I was working with, because we concentrate with those students that are at risk basically. I was working in an 8th grade classroom and that was really scary for me because obviously at that time I feel like I probably looked younger than I look now. So felt like they wouldn't take me serious. It was intimidating like I said but at the end of the school year we took the kids to dinner because they graduated. They had no F's. So it was just amazing to see that.",Student,woman
ID17,Clinical Work or Student Teaching,it's so rewarding to see that you're making that improvement with those students that you're inspiring them to get where they're going. It's just a reward to be honest with you just to see that growth and that blooming flower that is coming from those students. Working in the classrooms you hear a lot of teachers kind of saying that it's hard but at the end you're doing something for someone else. You're kind of like molding their little brains into what they're going to become. So being able to do that and kind of preparing the future with those kids.,Student,woman
ID17,Community Service,"we do a lot of community service. We have trainings once a month. I don't know, it's just like we're really involved with the community especially with that migrant community. We work in the classroom during classroom time. It's not like an after school program. I think that's a lot because a lot of the time I feel like those students are kind of like not focused so we get to help them out. What we focus on is trying to fill that learning gap that they have in English and in math. So, yeah, that's what we do. We recently starting doing DIBELS last year. That's how we're testing them and how we're trying to show the state that we're actually improving the students' education somehow.",Student,woman
ID17,Inspiration,"You see that it pays off that hard work that you're putting into it. It's really rewarding and being able to inspire them to “now I want to go to college”. Hearing that, it's a good feeling. When I was going to school I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. Like I said I never really had that teacher to ask me well what do you want to do for the rest of your life. I want to be able to give that to the students and being able to see that there's improvement even with those students that they think well they're not going to make it. You see that growth. Even if it's a little there's still something there.",Student,woman

ID17,Recruitment,"the coordinator went to go speak in one of the classes I was attending. She went to go talk about the program and my instructor at the time had been in the mini corps program. At first I was kind of scared. I wasn't sure. I had just graduated from high school and I don't know how I felt about actually working with students. So it was intimidating at first but he told me just try it and you're not going to lose anything. So, yeah, I just felt really good about it. That's how he ended up going into education as well.",Student,woman
ID17,Recruitment,"It was kind of a personal decision. I actually applied at Stanislaus as well and that's a lot closer from where I live. Yeah, it was a little personal issues I was having so then I thought you know I mean it's something different. I was a little scared, like I said, because I mean obviously financially it's very hard. I still drive from Merced here which that's like an hour. Yeah, I don't know. My teacher, like I said, was really encouraging for me to come here. So I felt like well am I going to lose so I decided for Fresno",Student,woman
ID17,Reflection,Why I joined the mini corps program in 2008 back in Merced College. I first started with a psychology major and it wasn't until I joined the mini corps program that I kind of decided like oh this is what I like doing. I don't know. I just kind of felt like it kind of related to me because I was a migrant student. I didn't really receive like that help when I was a kid. So I kind of felt like this was what I wanted to do to help the students kind of like that were going through the same thing I was. So that's how I became interested with migrant education and education in itself.,Student,woman

It was one book and everyone was sharing it. You have that connection and they're very helpful. They recommend teachers like oh this teacher is very good or this one you're not going to learn anything or little things like that. So we're very close, I feel kind of united. It's very nice. Like I said, the coordinators it's amazing how much they help us. They help us find resources to study for the CSET. That's our focus; trying to pass those. Yeah, that's a pretty big deal. Yeah, we have a really good connection as a group.",Student,woman
ID18,Campus Environment,"It's very diverse. There are students from everywhere on this campus, and I like that. It's, last time, there's a Subway down at the food court and I was standing in line, and there was two foreign exchange students, one from Portugal and one from England. And they were talking to each other. I guess they came together or they knew each other. And, I have studied Portuguese, and as soon as I heard that accent, I picked up on that and I asked her -0:16:11.1-, and she automatically responded with a -0:16:15.9- and that was like, oh, how cool, how neat. I just wanted to keep on talking to her, and so that I could pick up some more Portuguese and maybe have a conversation. The English student too, the one from England, she had the different accent as well, and it was just, it's just impressive that the campus can do that, that they can have foreign exchange students just like in high school, and I really liked that. And also, the people here, they're, the students there, let's see, they come from different, a lot of different backgrounds. There's, Fresno is a very diverse town as well. We have students from everywhere here. They come from the coast, they come from here from hometown, but the different sections of Fresno are different as well.",Student,man
ID18,Campus Environment,"But, yes, it's just, it's a different feeling, a different feeling. I feel like I belong here, I want to say. And since I had family here, my first year actually, it was the last year of one of my sisters, and I felt like I belonged here because I got to meet her friends, and then I had my friends from high school, or friends from middle school that we didn't go to the same high school, and elementary school, and you just feel like you connect automatically and that you belong with the people here, and it's a great atmosphere in this school.",Student,man
ID18,Campus Environment,"Yes, just being here with my sister. That first year, that first year was, we used to have lunch together every Wednesday because we had a class together, well not class together but at the same time, and we both had an hour break in between. So we would go down to the food court and that would be the times that we would eat lunch together. And it was, since my sisters belonged here, I felt like I belonged here as well because I had family here and it felt like at home being able to see my sister and enjoy a meal with her. With the professors as well, they make you feel like you belong here. They're there to help.",Student,man
ID18,Challenges,"he's just all around great person and there's, my students -0:20:10.7- most of them do come from farm labor background, like I do, and some of them sometimes don't have pencils, or paper, or notebooks. She made packets with notebooks, pencils, erasers, books, just many things, and she's going to deliver them this week to them. And she's just, it's a very caring program and we want the students to be life-long learners, like I said.",Student,man
ID18,Classroom Environment,"We spend countless hours in the classroom. We spend way more hours in the classroom than a student teacher would. And you pick up on different strategies. My first teacher I worked with, she was the strict time, that I want it quiet, I want the room quiet, type. And I learned great classroom management from her. Her lessons were concise, and they were just flawless lessons. But what she took from me, what she took away from me, well not away from me, but what she took from me was that to be a little bit more compassionate with the students and not just we're here to learn, and I clock off at 2:30, so she started staying and decorating the classroom, and I would stay with her and help her decorate sometimes as well.

I was going to do geology and hydrology. But working with Mini-Corps, it just, it opened my eyes to what I can do with students so I can help them.",Student,man
ID18,Inspiration,"t just opened my eyes to how I could help students. I started at my first school I started working at was a rural school, in a rural area, called Orange Center.

And, I just saw how much I could help the students and the impact I can make in their lives, and it changed my outlook on what I really wanted to do, because science, it is important and it's something that I have great passion towards. But seeing how I could change the students and I can help them make life-long learners, and I can help them like learning, that was just something different and something that I really enjoyed. And also, when I was in 6th Grade, I had a Mini-Corps tutor in my classroom and I wasn't aware that she was a Mini-Corps tutor. I was in the Migrant Program. And, she would come in every day and help us, help a small group of migrant students with math, and I just thought it was a college student doing some community service or doing her hours. And I remember, this is what I like about this program aside from the academics, the Mini-Corps tutors, there's something about it, just something special, and this I remember that we had a pizza party and I had … I didn't bring money that day but we had to each pay part of our pizza so we could get to participate in the party, and I actually didn't bring money that day and she went out to her car, and as a college student now I know that sometimes it is kind of hard on the pocket, it's she went out to her car and she actually brought in what she had, and she paid for me so I could participate in that party. And later on, actually my first year in Mini-Corps, I found out she was a Mini-Corps student, and I saw her again. I thanked her a lot.

And, the students there, most of them are migrant students. They all come from a diverse background. They're all Hispanic or Hmong. And, I just saw how much I could help the students and the impact I can make in their lives, and it changed my outlook on what I really wanted to do, because science, it is important and it's something that I have great passion towards. But seeing how I could change the students and I can help them make life-long learners, and I can help them like learning, that was just something different and something that I really enjoyed. And also, when I was in 6th Grade, I had a Mini-Corps tutor in my classroom and I wasn't aware that she was a Mini-Corps tutor. I was in the Migrant Program. And, she would come in every day and help us, help a small group of migrant students with math, and I just thought it was a college student doing some community service or doing her hours. And I remember, this is what I like about this program aside from the academics, the Mini-Corps tutors, there's something about it, just something special, and this I remember that we had a pizza party and I had … I didn't bring money that day but we had to each pay part of our pizza so we could get to participate in the party, and I actually didn't bring money that day and she went out to her car, and as a college student now I know that sometimes it is kind of hard on the pocket, it's she went out to her car and she actually brought in what she had, and she paid for me so I could participate in that party. And later on, actually my first year in Mini-Corps, I found out she was a Mini-Corps student, and I saw her again. I thanked her a lot. And it's just something different aside from teachers in the credential program or other programs.",Student,man
ID18,Student Needs,"One of the tutors that you're going to interview, she works at the school named -0:09:17.5- Elementary, and she worked there last year, but she still continues to go this year. And she visits her students, and they also come from a very diverse background there. They're needy students, and she collects clothes for them, and she gives them clothes, and she goes and donates time, and donates clothing items, food items, and that's something that she doesn't",Student,man
ID18,Student Needs,"he's just all around great person and there's, my students -0:20:10.7- most of them do come from farm labor background, like I do, and some of them sometimes don't have pencils, or paper, or notebooks. She made packets with notebooks, pencils, erasers, books, just many things, and she's going to deliver them this week to them. And she's just, it's a very caring program and we want the students to be life-long learners, like I said.",Student,man
ID18,Student Needs,"We want them to know that school's not there so that, for them to feel dumb, because that's how some of them feel. And that was me as well. Some of us feel like we don't belong at school because it's not something that our parents did. And, we don't want to make students feel dumb by them thinking oh I can't do this, this is too difficult. We want to help them; and she does a lot of that. And, we want to help them feel like it's somewhere where they belong, somewhere where they can feel comfortable so that they can learn. And that's something she does. She just, she's very approachable. She's just great. She's just great all around.",Student,man

So we would go down to the food court and that would be the times that we would eat lunch together. And it was, since my sisters belonged here, I felt like I belonged here as well because I had family here and it felt like at home being able to see my sister and enjoy a meal with her.

ID19,Challenges,"My biggest thing is the social like how do people view and the income of a teacher. Teachers don't get paid that much but it grows. It just depends on your resume. I can tell you can go into the school district to get paid $70,000 to be a teacher versus going to school and get paid $35,000 for a teacher.

Thursday we have our weekly meeting with all of the MISTER's and our academic coach. We talk about our experience and our week and what's going on and what's coming up and what's past and what we need to prepare for and whatnot. Friday is really more of a relaxed day.

I was talking to Dr. Latiker about it and he was like it's always about classroom management and how you come off to the kids. They'll respect you and they'll like you then they'll behave and listen to you. I ain't going to say his name but the teacher down the hall he had a problem with his kid. He was like because he don't do nothing fun. He just sit down and talk to the kids and tell them to do this and do that. But see I'm up talking to my kids and interacting with them and helping them out and it is not a boring class period. That's why they listen to me and like learning.

ID19,Experience being a minority teacher,learned it just depends on how you teach. One male teacher he didn't like his job. He was like just borderline I'm really about to quit. There was another teacher and he said he loved his job and they're in the same school right down the hallway from each other. I was confused about like how this teacher hated his job and this teacher is loving his job. I sat down in the class and the teacher that hated his job his children were running him wild and then you go down the hallway in the next block and the same kids go to the next male teacher's class and they're perfect students and sitting down and being quiet.

ID19,Future Plans,"I really want to be a principal and then work up to being like something higher than the principal, probably on the board for the district, probably work up to being that. I'll probably do like three or four years doing it and probably in three or four years I'll probably have my master's degree. So then I'd be able to apply to being a principal over a school. If you end up being a principal you get to work with more kids and see more kids. So I think I'd have a greater impact with the kids like that.",Student,woman
ID19,Inspiration,"What really interested me into teaching is when I got to Jackson State I applied and I was going to do undecided major. But then they came in, Dr. Latiker came in and he was telling me about the Call Me MISTER scholarship and the program and what it's about. So then he tells me to sit down and think about like throughout my education was there any male teacher that impacted my life. To be honest it was. In kindergarten and middle school and in high school it was always that male figure that helped me stay out of trouble and motivate me to finish school. So I want to give back like he told me like I should give back and be that male and role model to somebody else.",Student,woman
ID19,Inspiration,"had the little kids like the elementary kids. It was funny. I was working with this one guy during the summer and before I left he was like I wish you could be my dad or my stepdad. He was like my dad never do this and my dad never reads with me and you're fun. He was bold enough to tell me that. How many other kids am I reaching that haven't told me that yet? It shows that we actually do make an impact because when we're not there we actually have teachers say we had a child who was looking for you. I had a dentist appointment. I usually work with a certain group of kids and they were where he at, where he at. So when I got back they all yay we missed you. So it's probably five or six kids to the classroom and 30 or 28 kids waiting to learn and to see my face. You can be a big impact.",Student,woman
ID19,Mentorship,"Dr. Latiker he's our academics coach but I'm going to say he's one of the people who, he goes beyond his job. Even though we have to call him about something that's not dealing with school like I had a flat tire. I could call Dr. Latiker and he's be able to come and help me out if I need like advice dealing with relationships or family problems. He'll give me advice. He's really like a big brother or father or uncle to everybody. Whatever we need him to be he's there for us and he also helps us with our work whenever we need it. When we do a paper and we're not sure about the paper we can always email him the paper and he'll proofread it and he'll tell us you've got these mistakes and you need to go back and look over this. And like math when are you free? Okay, you're free Thursday at 1:00. Okay, I'll have a math tutor waiting for you. Make sure you'll be there. And say if we have an event coming up he'll email us to tell us about our event, what we need to do, what we need wear and what time we can meet up and all of the basic details about it. He's also the same person that tells us what you need to do about showing and you need to do this and do that or there's going to be consequences.",Student,woman

If we have a question about this coming up at high school and how teaching is going to be and the class is going to be they're going to help us out. All of them looking forward to seeing us teaching and want to see us doing good.

But without that it would be almost impossible just to be in the credential program and without financial aid, of course. But I've gone through the system and it's benefitted me.

It's more what can I learn today that's going to make me a better professional. So that's the highlight. I think Dr. Lomeli is one of the best professors as far as teaching preparation programs go.",Student,woman
ID21,Faculty,I think what makes him a good professor is the fact that he's humble and the fact that he cares. He knows his curriculum. I think every professor at the university is well prepared but not everybody has the attitude of caring for all students. I mean just as an undergrad you show up to some classes and the professors are there but they don't really even care to learn your name per se. That's not everybody but that's the difference between what makes a class interesting or not.,Student,woman
ID21,Faculty,"Just the fact that he, Dr. Lomeli shared one time he's the youngest of several siblings. He stated, I remember it clearly, when he goes to family dinners or family reunions he's Dr. Lomeli by no means. He's Pepe to everybody and his older brother he's a farmworker but he still gets on his case. So it's not because you have a Ph.D. doesn't make you better than everybody else in his family and in his culture. It's the same way for me. Just because I went to college doesn't mean that my older brothers think of me as in not in a bad way but just because I do have that respect for them and that's what we've been taught.",Student,woman
ID21,Inspiration,"I was born in Mexico and I came here when I was ten years old. So that was my fifth grade of elementary school. It took three years for me to learn the language and get fully integrated into the classroom. I come from the community of Mendota, which is about roughly 10,000 people, 45 minutes away from Fresno. It's 100% agricultural, 100% Hispanic and the only professionals that we get to see out there are teachers at the school. So that was really the only role models that I was exposed to.",Student,woman
ID21,Inspiration,"I saw in my teachers a lot of concern for the students. They developed clubs. I was in mountain biking club, I was in history club and I was part of those clubs without even knowing the language. My teachers were really concerned with getting me there, with integrating me into the classroom. I always saw that as being my career choice.",Student,woman
ID21,Inspiration,"I would say that being a teacher is the most rewarding job out there because you can make a difference in so many kids' lives. For example, I had a struggling student in junior high two years ago. I chose them as my smart gold student. I worked with them in math and he was kind of derailing and not being on task. He's a migrant student. So after working with him and counseling him and cooperating with the principal and his teacher he went on and graduated junior high. I saw him a couple of weeks ago and he's like, “Hey, Mr. -0:15:37- how are you?” “Good, how are you? What are you doing?” He's playing football, he's getting good grades and that's good. It's a different take on an attitude of what he had in junior high. He still remembers I remember math class this, this and that and those are all good anecdotes. When you get that and you feel that rewarding experience of saying hey you know I may have something to do with that. So I would tell a group of Latino students being a teacher gives you the chance to change your community and that's empowering. We don't really have much out there in Mendota. Just being a teacher is a way to change the way our students view life and just having the chance to give them those learning opportunities to go out there and experience the world because some of them they don't. They just stay in Mendota and they think that's it. For me that was the case until I came to the university.",Student,woman
ID21,Job Counseling,"It has a reputation for that and a good reputation for that because I think administrators and principals throughout the vicinity take note of where you're coming from. I think they see as a positive that you get your credentials here at Fresno State versus National University of Fresno Pacific just because of the rigorous program that this university has in place. The credential program also is a good program. The professors that we have, that I've had so far have really been good at teaching us about curriculum instruction, about professionalism, about just everything in general. They really emphasize different aspects of the curriculum and they base their instruction on research, on stuff that works. I really think I've had good preparation from the professors in the credential program.",Student,woman
ID21,Job Counseling,my 8th grade history teacher who is now the principal at the junior high. We have become lifelong friends because he was the one that pushed me from English learner classes to the mainstream classroom. He basically said you can do it. He pushed me to it. He went and talked to the principal and said you know what Carlos is ready for the mainstream classroom. He's got to do it. I said yes and it was hard at the beginning but I got through and we stayed in contact throughout my high school years.,Student,woman

ID21,Opportunities,"The high school learning director also we had a lot of learning experiences and we became lifelong friends but they were the ones that kind of motivated me and took me out to places as part of a group and here's what you can do. So I think just providing those chances for those students to get out of Mendota and see, hey, I can do this, I can do that. They hear about it but they don't really see a concrete model of what it means to be a fireman or a police officer or even vocational jobs. They didn't have that when I was in high school and now it's part of high school. They have an automotive club. They have several opportunities for the kids out there to experience different things. Just as far as the after school program at the high school which I'm part of too, I started a cosmetology club just as a vocational club for several students. There are 15 members and I have different people come in each week to give presentations as far as vocational schools, not necessarily and I do that because I want to tell those girls you don't have to go to a four year school but you can do other things other than just the fields. So just encouraging that out there and just making it available. Maybe some of them will follow through.",Student,woman

ID21,Resources,"I came straight from high school to Fresno State. I began my general education. My first year I thought I was going to be a history teacher. It didn't turn out that I liked that. I changed into multiple subject and that's when I became part of the mini corps program. The program has led me through the pathway of becoming a teacher. I think of all of the schools that I've been to just being part of the mini corps program they have prepared me a lot as far as professional development assessments. So hopefully next year when I do get a job I'll be able to slide right in without any further training as far as whatever the schools out there are doing. Usually it's new teachers, oh, we've got to do this, this, this, this and that and us a mini corps we get exposure to it. So we're able to just slide right in without further.",Student,woman
ID21,Student Needs,"I would say we need to talk about more of the student needs and not the curriculum. Curriculum goes and comes and it's the same thing recycled over and over again. My take on it is good teaching strategies are good teaching strategies no matter what. I think just meeting the needs of your students is more important rather than being in a conflict about which standards you should teach and making a difference, having a goal at the end and having those students meet that goal and doing something with their lives.",Student,woman

ID21,Support System,He's really down to earth. He appeals to every learning style even for us as students. He really cares for each individual student. It helps out that we have small classrooms in the credential program so it's only like 12 or 13 of us per session. I think Mr. -0:07:36- he's really knowledgeable in the subject of math and teaching through cognitively guided methods. Dr. -0:07:45- she's really good in teaching about reading and she cares for the students and she's really understanding of meeting deadlines if something happens.,Student,woman
ID21,Support System,"Just as far as teachers meeting with parents, parents out there in the rural community and this is just where I'm coming from, their attitude is they want their kids to get an education but they don't know the details. I mean they don't know math because some of them didn't even go to school and have never been to a school. They don't know English and they don't know any subjects. So when they go to school and the teacher asks do you have any questions about your child's education they're not going to have any questions because they don't know. So I would say your responsibility as a teacher is here's how your kid is doing in all of these areas and even though you don't know the language you can make sure that they have allotted time for their studies and access to different materials or whatnot. That's some of the things that I don't see out there and that's why I also decided to stay out there in the rural areas versus coming to Fresno to teach, just looking into the future a little bit.",Student,woman
