General collaboration means engaging in a conversation, in a dialog, to understand each other needs and interest, and then finding the way to go get to a point where the needs and interests of all the parties are met. It is a process where you communicate and negotiate, and develop some consensus about what is best for all the parties.
Francisco:
That's a pretty general definition, but that's the way I understand it. It's an iterative process. I mean, it's hard to get to that point at the first attempt, so you have to go back and forth until you feel comfortable to engage in collaboration with someone else."

Francisco:
Oh, well, I mean for me is ... How do I say it? There is this complementarity. I mean, there are things that you cannot do by yourself, that you need the expert needs, the resources, understanding, the relationship with someone else. Then you find someone that can provide all those things, and then you engage in collaboration.
Francisco:
Normally those are larger projects, the ones that you can do by yourself, alone. Normally in this particular context, which I do most of my collaboration, they are also more complex projects. Also, projects that have a different vision of all the things that you want to accomplish.
Francisco:
I mean, I can do a lot of the things that I do collaborate in by myself. I think so, but everything will be harder for me to accomplish the things I'm pursuing if I didn't have the support of my colleagues in Mexico now."

Francisco:
Okay. Well, there are many circumstances. I mean, I'll give you an example. I'm working right now on a project that is looking at issues of innovation in the US-Mexico border. The focus is Arizona and Sonora. We wanted to know, for example, how ... How do you say that in English? How pervasive, how generalized is the idea of innovation in universities and in the region on both sides of the border?
Francisco:
So that required doing interviews with researchers and students; we had the students and some people in government on both sides of the border. Because I am bilingual I can go and talk to people in the US and in Mexico, but it's easier for me, for example, to ask one of my colleagues, that I work with them for a long time, to help me in that project.
Francisco:
They will, for example, give me access to people that I normally won't have access in government, because even when I am Mexican, I am representing a US university. So I don't have the [inaudible 00:09:10], I don't have the presence, I don't have the connection that my colleagues from Mexico have. So, I can still do the interviews on the Mexican side, but as I said, it is going to be harder.
Francisco:
These are examples of a project I'm doing in collaboration with colleagues in Mexico, with which I collaborated in the past. These are all relationships. But also because you are engaged in these bi-national projects, people identify you as someone that can be the partner for Mexicans wanting to do something in the US. So you start developing new connections with [inaudible] as you work.

"ID33","Collaboration Examples",8,27,"Definition of Collaboration","social science",1,"M",0,"border state",0,"It depends on the project. For example, one thing I've been doing in the last four years is the creation of a theme that we called the Arizona-Sonora Interuniversity Alliance. What we are trying to do is to create a platform that facilitate collaboration across the border between US and Mexican universities in this part of the world. That's something that I initiated.
Francisco:
I remember myself going to University of Sonora, Colegio Sonora, CIAD and other higher education institutions in the area, knocking on the door of the Director of International Partnerships, going and knocking on the door of the director of the university, and telling them about the interests of my university and my school to develop a stronger connection with his or her university.
Francisco:
Sometimes people don't pay too much attention to you, but you have to insist. You have to be persistent and understand, as I said before, there is not, unless you attempt it, you will really attract the attention and then support of these people. You have to go back and talk to them, and convince them, persuade them that what you are pursuing is of their own benefit and on the benefit of your university. That you aren't doing this just because it is fun, but because there is a social impact that you want to produce as a result of this collaboration.
Francisco:
In this case for example, I initiated this in 2015. I was main director of a program that is called the Program for Transborder Communities, and I decided that the best way to make this program successful was developing these connections with Mexican universities. So that was the motivation and the way I did it. I went like a Babylonian [Spanish 00:17:18], knocking the door and trying to convince people that we were potentially a good partner for them.
Francisco:
We were competing with all the universities. I mean, ASU is pretty much active in collaboration with Mexico and globally, but in regard to Mexico, the University of Arizona, which is in Tucson, they have a stronger presence than us. So I was aware that I have to be as good as the University of Arizona in order to develop that presence in Mexico.
Francisco:
So this is a very large project. Since I started that we have signed some general collaboration agreements. We have had a couple of [inaudible] of universities meet and discuss the opportunities for exchange in research and education. It's a really big effort that I initiated in 19 ... in 2015, I'm sorry.
Francisco:
There are other things. There's smaller ones like, for example, a project in which I'm involved in the same region but in a smaller scale, because in order to see this in [inaudible] where basically I was just trying to replicate what I did with the alliance in that part of the world. I thought I could with some universities in Baja California, neighboring state, and initiate some small projects, nothing really big, in the area of [Hjel] and in Colombian development."

Francisco:
Well, in the alliance we are using local resources mostly. For example, ASU allocated some funding to support these efforts. While we are doing this through seed grants, through research seed grants. We are supporting projects that focus on issues of development pertaining to the Arizona ... the border region. We convince Mexican universities, for example, to create a singular parallel fund. So the University of Sonora, Colegio Sonora, and CIAD, and more recently Colegio from [Paranorque] and the University of Arizona, they decided to allocate some funding to support research from Mexico that want to do projects involving Arizona faculty. So we are not using CONACYT or NSF. Funding is just local resources.
Francisco:
Our hope is that once we demonstrate that the effort we are doing is productive, is impactful, CONACYT will say, ""Okay, here are some money you can use to keep promoting your idea."" That's our hope, because for ASU for example, this is an investment. They are seeing this as an initial investment. So the funding is going to be available for a year and a half, an extra year and a half, and after that we have to find a way to keep funding our activities.

I hear, for example, from people in the University of Sonora, that they are not able to attract American students.

I guess it's a combination of things, but one very important factor is the concern about security in Mexico.

For example institutional order they help to predict, for example if the oil prices of UNAM and for the institution too, for example right now they are debating on if they want to build refineries or not and a from my standpoint of view they should be using their natural gas that they have already have in the ground in Mexico in the north part of Mexico and to reduce the prices of electricity using gas because they use an oil plant, we use a lot of oil and so not the type of and then with the tech we also have some oil in the area of in the area of CANíT UNDERSTAND-12:47   helps to live the personal life of, I donít know if you are familiar of with the technology to then and so in order to fix the mathematics we are using different platforms and save the students.

And the thing is uh for example one area of topics the area of education with the minister of education and we frame the what is it called- high school teachers how to be better teachers of STEM as second language and also we help with the directors to be better directors of their sides and for thirty or forty years they send  a group of faculty and also the institute of technology con national which is a very large system, itís a growing system. So then we have four campus, over 6 thousand students all over the country and with them it has also been time to help the researchers of that system to make proposals in English. So they come and also entrepreneurship has also been a high topic and for example we have been in our office how to commercialize the part of the that come from the university we work a lot with them. So I would say that not totally engineering because entrepreneurship has been a big part of a area also and the area was all- well communication later but uh also the area of public policy and we have been working with the for example itís a the public school of the ASU they have been working and putting a symposium for the last three years every year in the area of public policy. Specifically right now in the area of international trade and how that is going to effect and how for example we are going to they are asking for a grant for making a trade between Mexico and the United States and it is different in the United States States you see? And how does effect the areas of policies that you are going to take in the last hour, the last hour how did that effect every state in particular? In every state of how have the areas been effected. So this is another dynamic model of existing model and also in the area of public policy. You see the energy that we work is for public policy, you see public policy and also this new part of pride is in public policy ok?"
"ID10","Collaboration Examples",2,27,"Definition of Collaboration","education",1,"M",0,"border state",0,"Well here I can tell you the experience in usually the we typically you have a visit of back and forth and within a specific area where we can work and are interested in for in the Mexican side and from the university side ok? So for example the power of electrical engineering is very specialized and group who work together at ASU. I will just give you a little bit of background but the electrical system is, the electrical system, they werenít delivering anything new, now with the renewal energies, one example is Germany, when you put a very thematic supply of energy who come from the side of the earth, some place else, the electrical alliance becomes very stable. For now, itís a time, for the world, for the United States, for Germany, for France, to see how they are going to control this new systems. With more sustainable energy look with this growing system stability will become. So, you have to have a cultural balance, with computer systems to take care of that. So thatís a big issue, an example of that, that is something that we find a group at ASU. So you were telling me, itís a group where we are recognized and where, and a reason why regular universities, you donít here about this group because you see everything is something new and micro and electronics like that. But this, you know these are the issues right now in Mexico and in the United States. So we have to find out job as an office is to find what needs to or what are the needs of Mexico what needs to happen and find out if itís a group or a professor and the next thing is to start to find funds which is sometimes the most difficult and right now we have been depending very much on the Mexican side ok? And these are the ones who will be supplying the money for all of this collaboration. To some extent the university can receive money for federal projects for a starting point. So you need you need a little bit of money from both sides, so you can look for funds and once you have funds you can look for proposals and everything and put people to work to communicate and make sure that the thing is running. So our office is to make the things run, and something to stop, we donít have authority over these projects but we want to be sure to make that they are able to work back and forth ok? So I donít know if I explained the process but you have to look for the problem, that is very important you see? What I see happening many times is the professors like to start something that they are interested in a different way and my approach is to look for projects that are very beneficial for both, for both countries, or at least for Mexico. And the problem is to see how we can form it, like you right now are solving a problem, more exchanges, more collaborations, rather than restraints ok? So we have to start with the same problem, we have to, what I donít advise is to start a first draft with something that is just for publishing and that is what many professors for sure do. See they think that publishing, and for ASU, and to look at what Mexico is and to solve a deep problem that hasnít been solved. You first have to be, have to have a objective, and of course there are several researchers that have started many things for their main research and things like that but we focus more on the specialized problems that we need to solve in an urgent way. Ok?"
"ID10","Collaboration Outcomes",2,28,"Definition of Collaboration","education",1,"M",0,"border state",0,"Well here I can tell you the experience in usually the we typically you have a visit of back and forth and within a specific area where we can work and are interested in for in the Mexican side and from the university side ok? So for example the power of electrical engineering is very specialized and group who work together at ASU. I will just give you a little bit of background but the electrical system is, the electrical system, they werenít delivering anything new, now with the renewal energies, one example is Germany, when you put a very thematic supply of energy who come from the side of the earth, some place else, the electrical alliance becomes very stable. For now, itís a time, for the world, for the United States, for Germany, for France, to see how they are going to control this new systems. With more sustainable energy look with this growing system stability will become. So, you have to have a cultural balance, with computer systems to take care of that. So thatís a big issue, an example of that, that is something that we find a group at ASU. So you were telling me, itís a group where we are recognized and where, and a reason why regular universities, you donít here about this group because you see everything is something new and micro and electronics like that. But this, you know these are the issues right now in Mexico and in the United States. So we have to find out job as an office is to find what needs to or what are the needs of Mexico what needs to happen and find out if itís a group or a professor and the next thing is to start to find funds which is sometimes the most difficult and right now we have been depending very much on the Mexican side ok?

So you have to have a system where in order for congress, for congressmen to have implications with the policies. You see? I want to give you an example, right now they US congressman and Mexico they say well everything should be green which has moved solar and the wind energy because of the future. Well ok, that is an good idea, letís put a, that implies that there is an investment, how much it implies the cost of the energy how much it implies the development of a session of the green jobs in the country.  So sometimes the policy makers just think that one power, that they are going so solve that they are going to keep. And the innocent part is that my removing, that is the same thing in the United States that they are afraid of all the generations that you have, the gas right now is less expensive that coal so why donít you move more of the gas supply instead of trying to subsidize the coal? All because of the politicians, ok thatís a policy. In Mexico we have a similar problem, we have a oil supply doing the environment I guess an empowerment, you start using natural gas which is cleaner and thatís less expensive! So you have to move to the renewal energy ok? But you have to do it by steps. You can not do it one day, but you finish the whole thing. And so that is a good thing that you have to, so why do sometimes, we donít go alone, is because we donít have a clear sense of what we want to solve.

You have to improve the quality of education in the United States and Mexico. So that is the challenging problem.

I will start with this example, it is very aggressive, it was to come and visit us, ok?

Arizona is a very under the mellow state compared to California or Texas but at the end, that state is the best in the the trade that they can do with Mexico, you see congress is not aware of that and they just think they want to stop the difference because they are mad and they are all despiteful, then at the end I think the state is going to suffer if the state of Arizona so you have to make the word of why we have to collaborate instead of being quiet or trying to separate the two countries in a very not policy making way. You see the thing is, you have to develop, the central Americans are coming here, well that is because their economic stability is very low, and how central America comes to develop, we are always going to have insecurity, we are going to have depression, I donít care how many walls that you put.

That case, my personal preference is to find partners the same level. Now it's a requirement in Brazil, but at the time I decided to start cooperating who could follow the research. Reasonable independent just of me. That they could own it too. That's how it started, and it worked. And now my colleagues in Brazil, they have their own project and similar to what we started."

Can you elaborate on that? How is that?
Dr. Alvarado:
You have more indigenous people still living ...

Here people don't depend too much, even in the reservations, on their own resources. It's more cultural. But in Latin America there are still people doing slash and burn, in the traditional way.

Iím probably have done that more than anybody else in my center, also the people in the US my colleagues tend to be very willing and interested in going to Mexico so thatís a plus. I canít say that for everybody. I have asked other people and they donít work out well. So I donít push that, for the most part my colleague really to go. He is kind of a good guy and safe guy. So yeah, the teaching has been a major part. One of the part that I enjoyed the mostÖthere are conflicts joys and conflicts with students stuff like thatÖthatís universal.

Sometimes personal expensesÖin order words is not to deal with the bureaucracy of the Mexican institutions so a lot of time I just have to take money out of my pocket just to make it smooth and fast.

For example, making the UNAM where I work less bureaucratic much less administrative oriented that would help facilitateÖthatís a cultural change. To give you an example my center, I think we are only 57 researchers  but we have like 10 people just to work in the finance department just to give you an idea. In the US it would be one for all 50 but in Mexico itís 10 but they created these jobs and they created this bureaucracy within jobs so thatís kind of controversy so you get a lot ofÖprocesses that should really take a day they will take like a week even though you have a lot of people working."
"ID2","Institutional Context",6,38,"Institutional Context","science and engineering",1,"M",0,"not border state",0,"In the US side, again I think the structure is okay but the university I think in the last couple of decades has taken on the business model which the universities are not really design to be profit generating machines, there are investment in the future so I think that counting mentality in the fact that for example so many researchers in the US are soft money they have to make a little bit of work to pay their own salary basically given funding so I think thatís very counterproductive too for science because youíre not allow to have the time to sit and think about things youíre worry about your health care and salary. In Mexico, you donít have to worry about that, everything is pay for as a full-time researcher everything is covered in that respect. Iíve worked with a lot of people in the US that are soft money and they got three or four different projects going on and I donít know how they do it and then they have family and stuff like thatÖI donít understand how can they have enough time in the day to really carry out the research carefully, write the paper carefully and train the students carefully thatÖbut again thatís a culture part of the US system that kinda accepted now.

I expanded the group greatly. Iím on sabbatical right now in Rutgers? with a colleague from that project and they actually make connection between themselves and even with Mexican colleagues but a little more limited. Those exists. And then we had another one call Kasmex? [37:30] itís a consortium for Arizona and Mexico, and thatís UAConnaci? to continue on that project. Again more useful, and my colleagues at the U of A do have relationship independent of me now with other people and my institution but itís fairly limited.

Itís function and itís been good but we still waiting to do kind of a bigger project that could be much more long term but not really hopeful giving the situation in the US right now and the last couple of years but that would be the idea to do the seed funding? that weíve done and then converting them into longer terms research project.

For example, I was part of a small horizontal, relatively horizontal structure at my university in California, I could unilaterally negotiate memorandum of understanding or something like that or call up people on the phone and said hey would you be willing as a department received scholars from this center in Mexico every three years and give them an office so they can help.

In that sense, [inaudible 00:06:44] very important and having these collaborated proposals help us substantially understand, number one, how we can help the Mexican counterpart develop certain skills that they don't have. What we get in return, as a US institution, is hopefully an influx of really highly skilled, smart students. For me, having a research project, joint project with Mexico has helped me recruit VIP students for my program here in the US. Now, how did I get to the point of having a joint project with Mexico? It's quite simple, right? I never lost touch with the people back in Mexico that I know. I've driven a lot to Mexico to anytime that somebody might invite me to be part of their dissertation committee, or to attend, give a talk in a conference, or be part of advisory boards.

It's called ConTex, Conacyt Texas. I'm part of their executive advisory board. Let me tell you a little bit about this. I think programs like ConTex will be great to have. ConTex has three different or supports three types of collaborations with Mexico and Texas. Number one is research projects. You write a proposal, and they will give you $100 thousand a year for two years to engage Texas. Actually, when I say Texas, it's only the UT system, the University of Texas [inaudible 00:25:02] with Mexico. That's a team research program. They also have about 30 or so fellowships for PhD students, and 10 post doctoral positions every year. This is a program where the UT system puts half of the money, and the Conacyt [inaudible 00:25:19] puts the other half of the money. This program, ConTex ... I would encourage you to kind of look at ConTex, or if you're interested, Taylor, I can put you in contact with the director of ConTex in the US, so you can talk to her. She will tell you more about ConTex.
Manuel:	These kinds of programs ... ConTex, where you support research, you support students in post doctoral positions are great, especially because this is an ongoing program. This is a program that is supposed to last for years and years. We have every once in a while a call for [inaudible 00:26:01] from the air force [inaudible 00:26:03] Conacyt and have a project like that, or a joint call between the army and Conacyt. But those are random, they are not necessarily program calls. Having a call, a yearly call where you can engage with the Mexican ... the institution, that would great. But then, I'm thinking ... The researcher's like, ""Maybe this year there will be a call. Maybe next year, maybe the year after."" I would say that what the US will do is define a collaboration strategy, so that us, the researchers, know what to do, what to expect.
Manuel:	If they say, ""Okay, we want to have a concept proposed unto Mexico and in the US once every two years,"" I know that I need to get ready once every two years, instead of just waiting for somebody to come up with a proposal, [inaudible 00:27:04] proposal. ConTex does exactly that. ConTex, we know that every March that the deadline for [inaudible 00:27:12], PhD, and proposal submission. The [inaudible 00:27:18] fact of ConTex is that there are two million dollars per year for this program, so it's a limited amount of money. Even with the proposal [inaudible 00:27:32] that will be [inaudible 00:27:33] the US and Mexico by 70 of having a regular quote for proposal, regardless of what the field is. It could be in chemistry, it could be in social sciences, it can be in physics.

Well, before you even go and start the proposal, if it's approved, you have some sort of training in just how things are going in Mexico. There're some good things, there are some bad things, but we need to be aware of both. My final recommendation would be aware, or make sure that you make the researchers in the US aware of how things are done in Mexico. How is that done? By having a simple tutorial, or course, or training, or whatever you want to name it, so that they are not caught by surprise."

For example, I was part of a small horizontal, relatively horizontal structure at my university in California, I could unilaterally negotiate memorandum of understanding or something like that or call up people on the phone and said hey would you be willing as a department received scholars from this center in Mexico every three years and give them an office so they can help. People would say yes and then we make it happened. And the structure at the national university here in Mexico is enormous and itís very bureaucratic.

And while I have been working in Mexico for a long time, I havenít been inside that particular university structure.

Yes, yes, do these wonderful international things but donít ask too much. And that really came to head with the Fulbright because I was asked to collaborate by the Mexican scholar colleague at the research center while I was on sabbatical. So when I got tenured and I went on a sabbatical leave for a semester and connected with this Mexican colleague and she said wouldnít it be great if we could work on this other project, what was the possibility of you staying? Well I have to go back because Iím the department chair, but Iíll look for opportunity to come back to work with her. And I found that the Fulbright and when I won the Fulbright, my home university was not cheerily accepted, they were happy to have the prestigious Fulbright school but they were not too excited about me not being there for the next year. It was because of the position I was in, I was the department chair and I was also the top-head of two interdisciplinary programs at that point.

"ID1","Collaboration Examples",1,27,"Definition of Collaboration","social science",1,"F",1,"not border state",0,"Anailese	Depend on what is the partnership for, right. So I think if the partnership is just to promote exchange scholars then mechanism can be for example offering office space, offering housing, having sort of memorandum of understanding where you said we will have a one on one, you send us a scholar for one year and we will send one next year, vice versa. So that kind of exchange seems relatively easy to set up. I see in the natural science that it is harder to set up. For example, in my case, so if I collaborate with [cut off 39:26-29] product of our research going to be [cut off 39:31-39:43] discovery of technology then things tend to get a little messier because we have to define what is the percentage of participation of each research and if there is a commercializable product then who get to commercialize it to get patent so those things tend to get a littler messier in field like biotechnology.

I may have a good lead for that but the very first thing that is coming to my mind and I think because more of the US culture is about the way that we have framed in the US failure to succeed. Ok? I think in general in the US and in higher education my particular, we donít have high degrees in certainty. And based on the reality of Mexico right now, if you see in the Conojso paper and Mexican paper than you will see what is happening right now. And I think that we need to permit that there are certain degrees of risk in assigning and implementing partnerships with Mexico. So I really think that, I hope someone would have been telling me this 20 years ago. Because I get that message will be to more relaxed because I have high amounts of stress from the very beginning. So its for us, and I guess to my point to relax and permit corresponding risk to innovate and to decide together. And allowing the differences that in some instances may be impossible but we are thinking about that we need to push what we are thinking and to be persistent to keep going and to work together and collaborate together and think about what is happening right now extra.

You know, you have this information exposed to you through other testimonies but its posted for you, that higher education in the US Mexico, is an amazing inventory of all the collaborations that are happening but at Conosejo its mainly a technology collaboration and is definitely the many other  thing they have on the agenda in terms of a corporation and research agenda in terms in terms of social science um and even arts uh, and others! And thatís not the case, thatís not the collaboration that we have here in  UT Dallas, but there is plenty of room to be even bigger and to expand that collaboration or lets say what has been the exercise of UT Dallas and US Mexico Science of Technology and others to share their experiences in social sciences and humanities in higher education related to Mexico.

Thatís one thing they should working directly with Mexican higher education institutions selling a collective scholarship program. There is also locally working with a Mexican, the culturally general to present the case and for them to help me, to promote that partnership with Mexico to the administration of Mexico and they really help me to be promoting this program within their own network of the mexican movement and gradually to be more visible and exposed to the Mexican environment general sense of higher education. Also kept close very much with USA and with Meixco asking for guidance to see how I was able to be more direct to be promoting this destination and then also to have more elements to be competing in a more effective way to include mexican students. What I am saying is I was competing, and still competing because Mexicans they can go anywhere to study at grad institutions, to pursue graduate education programs because education in Mexico institutional guarantees, there is no cost at all for them to go to uh walla wall in Australia or to Cambridge in the United Kingdom etc. etc. because maybe the Mexican Center for Institutional Technology exchange full scholarship, full support for them to pursue um doctoral programs or masters programs. So at some point I was competing with other key nations in terms of higher education and may aspects of technology like Germany for instance or competing with England I was competing with Japan, with south korea, and may other great destinations that explicit in their portfolio of connections for their Mexico students to pursue graduate programs. And so the US embassy was very careful in this process and especially the division in cultural affairs that they have no commit work as well and it has been providing different circumstances that can pass to be able to elaborate and in this presence to reach with Mexican students"

And each presentation had up to half an hour of the session afterwards when people got very excited, we've had a person who specialized in denim, was had one to develop that side bet we've had or the treated patients who were bitten by snakes. We had one who understood the physiology of the lymphatic system if they've never worked together before and each one gave a presentation.
Dr. Boyer:
And then we spent the rest of the week doing preliminary experiment when we would design an experiment each day and the students would rush off and set it up. When we had a small army of people correcting us preliminary data and by the end of the week we had to fully thought out plans for PhD this work. And in fact, two of the students that were in that room went on to get PhDs. It's very, very multidisciplinary fashion with collaborating supervisors in multiple institutions and doing that, having the students follow up on the shared goals of the professors works beautifully for everyone because we students could benefit from learning multiple things and from traveling and the faculty got to see things happen that could never have taken place and just one last."

When I look back on it, there was only one of the faculty members presence, one of the secondary ones.

"ID50","Collaboration Examples",17,27,"Definition of Collaboration","health science",1,"F",1,"border state",0,"Oh, I have a number. I have recently wrapped up and we're collaborating to write up a clinical trial. That is heart of a shared human medical kind to animal model collaboration, which is different from most other clinical trials. We study rare diseases, so it's made by Scorpion sting, spider bite, Ebola, things that are super rare. You can't just design a huge a placebo controlled double blind clinical trial across multiple sites. They just ... it doesn't work. So what we've had to do is negotiate with the FDA, what if we get the best information we can from an animal model and combine that with the best data we can squeeze from the occasional patients and we've just finished publishing the animal model, which is the one based on the PhD thesis which I told about and we've just simultaneously wrapped up the clinical trials. So instead of the traditional, do all the science first, then change here and do all the clinical work looking at time opinions because by collaborating we can help them at each other's work more.
Dr. Boyer:
We can get started with the clinical fiber 10 years earlier in a drug development cycle than you otherwise would say it's definitely tied in money and it's also a much more joyous process. Writing off a clinical trial right now that will be the parallel process to that laboratory. And then we have an additional collaborative project which started with the same group of people that had his new ones where we've discovered that because we were collaborating, we were attracting donated historical artifacts and people around North America really, we're excited to give us things that would otherwise go away. That represents a hundred years of our field. And the more that we accumulated and right now I've got a selection of 3000 files of add to that on the things like that. The more we realize we were sitting on the best source of studiable materials in the world on this topic and the Smithsonian got excited about it.
Dr. Boyer:
And so we're now looking for funding sources to enable collaboration that will be academic centers in the US and Mexico. It's Smithsonian, the FDA and the American Zoo and Aquarium Association. So it would be just really cool to get that. And when people see that you're having a fun collaboration with to meet cool people in travel, they want it to end, that it comes easier[inaudible 00:08:41] Fourth Project Rolling. It's hard to get funded for it. Nobody[inaudible 00:08:47] like, oh my gosh, it's a nightmare.

It's been uniquely bad because not only is it a rare condition, but the various offices at NIH and FDA that support rep conditions. Those house that support there rep conditions. [inaudible 00:09:35]And it's the getting the tide is beginning to turn. There's been some lobbying at the WHO level and whatnot. What was the current presidential administration? We're never going to get the companion rules change. I'm personally excited to be considered for education United States. And so it's ... that will have to wait until we have a different administration and in the meantime we operate on the fringes of scientific society. But it's cool. If you do something rare, I honestly think it's easier to collaborate when it should do something common. I feel sorry for my medical college medicine who work in cardiology, for instance.

Getting a visa for a Mexican students come up here and work for a while is hard because they have to prove that they have financial stability, all this stuff and nobody believes they're going to go home even though their home institution has a better science lab than mine. Of course they're going to go home and finish that PhD. Why on earth would they stay here where they're working with the clinician to learn a little bit about FDA stuff and there's no good way to persuade the visa system that it's okay for them to be here. I can't pay for certain things when they're here. The state of Arizona puts all kinds of rules on how I spend state money, so I ended up, I treat them to lunch. I treat them that on my own dime, out of my own pocket. I don't tell me you have it.
Dr. Boyer:
I have paid for students transportation. I have paid for their hotel because the hassle you have to get to go through to get things covered is terrible. The worst right now is my poor Fulbright Jaya has been, well, she tried for a full year to overcome a barrier and we finally had to give up when she applied as a PhD to do a Fulbright in the US she got a strong letter, not only for me, not only from her mentor in Mexico, but from a person at the FDA who said she's welcome to come spend most of her Fulbright.
Dr. Boyer:
We will sponsor at the FDA because we need collaborators who are going to be in Mexico who will help Mexico bringing up the standards, help us communicate with the Mexican Regulatory Authority. This is a very important niche for a future worker in the pharmaceutical industry. Well, so Fulbright, the scholarship, she was given the award and that was time to get a visa. And to get the visa. You have to have a letter from the sponsoring institution saying that a physician is waiting for you and it had to be routed through the FDA. That was right after Trump was elected.
Dr. Boyer:
And you know, you're not allowed to work at the FDA unless you have already been in the United States legally for three out of the last five years. It's not a law, it's an interpretation of the regulations. The big couldn't get around it. We spent months and months and months trying to get someone senior enough for the FDA to sign off on letting a Fulbright scholar that they had already agreed to sponsor that split in the building. What the question was Mexican and she ... I mean, how would a Fulbright be here for three out the last five years? Doesn't happen. They're from other countries. That's the point. So FDA will never be able to have a foreign Fulbright under the current federal rules.

And we try to fried fried, I called the congressman, I did all this stuff and we finally said, okay, okay, she's mine. She's coming to the University of Arizona and she'll take a vacation while she's here to Washington DC. And so she came, she spent a month with me. She got on the plane, she went to DC, they let her in as a visitor. Where she could walk not to enter the laboratory, not as any of the places we want to do the work. Said hello to everybody. And then rented an apartment a few blocks from the FDA and we'd have lunch with the people that were supposed to be teaching her in the lab so that she could at least be there and attend some public conferences. And we set her up at the Smithsonian instead, which has the same federal laws that they haven't figured out how to keep Mexicans out because it's a public museum.
Dr. Boyer:
So she was walking into the museum and meet people and all under my supervision at a distance. And so now she's back in Tucson. We're doing what we can to make it a good collaborative Fulbright experience. And I think in the end we will have succeeded, but what a pain. I can't tell any of the students that I have trained in how to do international pharmaceutical science. I can't promise to open the doors for them that I would hold open for any US student, even though those are the collaborators. We need to look at the pharmaceutical industry in Mexico and how desperately it needs to be harmonized and its regulatory environment with what we have in the US look at how have you, given these are the best and the brightest, but Mexico has to offer and we've had so many jokes that it makes people want to throw up about whether I'm inviting criminals and rapists sober.
Dr. Boyer:
These are PhDs, these are people who know stuff we don't know. FDA has called me on occasion and said, we need help with an Ebola project and there's no place in the whole United States that knows how to do the old fashioned [inaudible 00:30:43] can you get the Mexicans to help us? And I said yes. And they said, here's the problem, we can't pay them. And I had to figure out a structure so they can pay a US entity that could then pay a Mexican entity to help the US with a public health problem. So we have really, really annoying and regulations.
Dr. Boyer:
So I don't think it's a matter of law. I do think it's a matter of the interpretation of the regs and that's just your politics right now. It's also been really bad for the US brand in Mexico. I was welcomed early in my career and now I go down and thank goodness they know who I am because because a US citizen stepping foot in the country otherwise right now people just give them the UNSW degree wanting to know what they think of the wall and things like that. It's painful."

So when I would tell him 15 years ago we'd had this interview, I would have told you my big dream is to have a situation where students in both countries can have a degree from their host institution in their own country, but with some sort of formal structure acknowledging the internationality of the work they do. Because we were sending students both directions and we were doing undergraduate, master's, PhD, Postdoc, everyday holly. So we're doing continuing education and we're going back and forth and it needed to be something you could put in your CV. It needed to be something ... It was a credential that was useful for something, and I talked it off a number of times, but the U of A which is a state institution and as a structure in place for out of state tuition and things like that, that sure if policy will pay full out of state tuition for all of the Mexicans would come up here.
Dr. Boyer:
And I said, yeah, but they're not even coming up for us. The Metro, they're coming from a month to hang out with my lab to learn a few techniques and they're going back. How about a certificate program? How about if I'm on their thesis committee in Mexico and we have a colleague in Mexico who can be on a thesis committee up here and we have annual event. And they basically said, great idea, great idea. Yeah. You should do that. But then like, okay, how am I going to pay for it? Who's going to help me go to the NSF? Who's gonna support this? And that's where being in a rare field sales thing, because there wasn't a critical mass of people at my own institution for once. We'll see this specific research I was doing to think. They love the idea of some kind of combined project. And if there had been three or four more people like me collaborating with Unum, we might've pulled her off.
Dr. Boyer:
But when I looked at the others at the University of Arizona that we're collaborating with Mexico, there was a big project where basically Mexican students could benefit from U of A. That's not cool. I've written. There was a big project where what wants to do is move a telescope across the border and set it up in Mexico and it will benefit the Mexican astronomers. Well that's cool, but it's not really like mine. And so I gave up, it seem waste of my time to make presentations and attend educational conferences and transport or conferences that we had in Tucson because people would always sort of trot me out to prove that you could elaborate. I have mine is gone over two decades now and we've got several drugs for the U of A FDA and we can show that we've stayed live for children in Arizona. I'm a great [inaudible 00:37:15] show, but I've never had support to build it beyond that.
Dr. Boyer:
So I'm afraid with my retirement, it's going to die. I want you to go on forever. So just my Mexican collaborators and we're so frustrated, but I've decided that I'm channeling it, that I'm going to write a book and that's my big project today. When I hang up the phone with you, I'll be writing the book.
Adam:
well, I mean, it's depressing and exciting at the same time.
Dr. Boyer:
It's was crazy maverick too when you tell them no, you can't do it. They find a different route to getting Derek tasks accomplished. My task is not really to set up an enduring Inter-institutional program if it's [inaudible 00:38:10] to keep these children alive in the future after the collaboration guys and after this company eventually goes bankrupt and there'll be a new cycle if somebody will have to bring in a new drug and if we don't have a lasting structure for continuity, we'll have to have a robust mechanism to be revised later."

"ID50","Political/Legal Challenges",17,47,"Challenges","health science",1,"F",1,"border state",0,"Okay. Both real and perceived issues of safety traveling and they go both ways. So during SB 1070 he's not made a general announcement with students that it wasn't safe to go to Arizona. And there are a lot of people know who feel that if they come off here and they'll be harassed-
Adam:
And wait is SB 1070, the racial profiling, license-
Dr. Boyer:
Yeah. Yeah. Is it the one that said any official of the earth on a government that can counter the person that they had reason to suspect might be in the country illegally, which required to demand proof of their citizenship and to X coordinate basically. And I was an official of the Arizona government. I was the head of the Arizona poison center and I'm studying a drug and we were having little children come in under emergency circumstances on, a lot of them have Mexican surnames and probably some of them were Mexican citizens. And I was not about the [inaudible 00:40:12] mothers of Diane baby, by the way. What's your citizenship?
Dr. Boyer:
In order to give them a Mexican drug, it had been donated for free to Arizona by a Mexican family. It's just pathetic and it's made everyone, I was collaborating with Mexico so mad. Why are we supporting Arizona? Why are we saving their baby? And it was really, really hard. And then on top of that, the university down there said undergraduates couldn't come up and they were through their support for undergraduate scholarship for a while.
Dr. Boyer:
It would eventually reversed, but it took a lot of work by different university interests and then going the other way. There's this issue of whether Mexico is thinks when Mexico is not always, there are parts of this and there are times when there are people for whom it's very dangerous to travel. There's a lot of ignorance in the US about what that means [inaudible 00:41:12] I get a truck a lot of the big spark website, which goes state by state in Mexico and says which ones are safe? That's based on data from the capital city for the state. And I don't go to the Capitol cities mostly I go to the rural areas where the horses on this next are and what space and what not does not follow the pattern. That's on the stage park website.
Dr. Boyer:
The only way for me to know what faith is to have a warm, friendly to the point of loving relationship with my collaborators who would not allow me to risk my life and who would have scored me any place that was necessary and who would make sure that I have a good driver if I need one. It's only by having a really good collaboration that I can go to Mexico over and over and over and just feel really safe twice. While I was in Mexico, we had mass shooting in Tucson in my hall. So Gabby Giffords was shot at my grocery store while I was in Mexico and the nursing college and the Pharmacy College at the U of A had a mass shooting the right text to my poison center while I was in Mexico. And the Mexicans think Tucson it's the wild west because I've been down there and my office and my home grocery get shot up and their office has never been shot up and their home grocery has never been shot up even though they have bodies in the streets.
Dr. Boyer:
And so there's this weird issue traveling where we fear each other and I think programs like Fulbright, student exchanges, things that are pure cultural, I just want art and music all over the place, crossing a border so that month here's, we'll feel that Mexican people can be nice and that and that there's humans and then it's okay to go down at the power because there's this terrible cultural expectation right now that it's just one big wild, dangerous zone. And so that's an issue. And then there's the reality opposite there is danger. And I've certainly with bad things happened and I've had several friends get kidnapped and a couple of places that I visited get blown up, but that's not unique to Mexico. I've had played the feathers get blown up in other countries. So somebody's trying to call me. I think it's an insurance salesman [inaudible 00:43:53].
Dr. Boyer:
So, yeah, safety and perceived lack of safety are something that needs to be addressed. Crossing the border"
"ID50","Political/Legal Challenges",17,47,"Challenges","health science",1,"F",1,"border state",0,"kay, so I'll have a student from Mexico who wants to come to the United States to use a machine that goes ping that we have up here and they have a little bitty test tube. Okay. It's one inch long and it's contained two and a half milligrams. That's makes sense and they collected the snake venom legally and humanely from a Mexican snake in Mexico and they want to carry two and a half milligrams of material across the border into the US if they follow legal procedures, they have to declare it as a biologic.
Dr. Boyer:
It will be confiscated. Putting foreign seen, it'll be stored in a place that it's not kept at the right temperature. It will be spoiled. It'll will take six weeks. We'll finally get it in. Their experiment will be ruined. They have to ship it in advance with paperwork that costs more to process and ship sends students tickets as it has to come in advance. Think it through, maybe get rejected. Maybe try again before I can have them come up here. How do you time the visa for that? We need to have the ability, the way that commercial transport of materials goes for academic transport of materials, there needs to be a way for the professors of the two institutions to sign off on this is a legitimate part of our certified collaboration and it's not dangerous and it's not illegal.
Dr. Boyer:
Let's the student put it in his pocket and walk across the border or land in the airport. As it turns out, I've done it every possible way. We have used every possible legal mechanism both directions. We have smuggled both directions. We have paid others to smuggle both directions. And honestly, my favorite is for me to do the smuggling personally, I don't ask the students to, because the Mexican students have lose their ability to come here for a minute late just by getting busted once. I get to come back to the US no matter what. So I actually carry the legal documents with me but I smuggle and I don't show the legal documents because the risk if you declare that is so high that they'll be taken away quarantined them destroyed."
"ID50","Political/Legal Challenges",17,47,"Challenges","health science",1,"F",1,"border state",0,"Insurance is another one. Medical Insurance, there are a lot of rules from US side that you can't employ somebody at the university unless they have health insurance and the health insurance has to qualify under certain rules. We need to have a nice easy to do. If you're a student traveling, this will cover you for the month that you're in the country kind of insurance understanding either from Mexico or for the US but it's crazy that I have to ... like at the last minute after we finally got an experiments set up, I'm notified, oh this was one of the students where you have to pay for insurance. Cut a check out of my personal account for 180 bucks so they can have medical insurance and they can come up. That's a big pain.
Dr. Boyer:
It should be something that's built into the structure of collaboration is that we have every student is injured while they're here rather than having to apply and do things where you want to be able to say, come on up the experiments next week, jump on a plane. But if you have to plan months in advance, you can't do that."

We did not have time for that. And we did not have that problem in the Mexican side. In the The Mexican side, american [mexican] institutions were very grateful that they had an opportunity to collaborate even with other mexican universities across the border.

But, after that, I have seen growing interest in studying abroad among american universities. In mexican universities, they are also more open about mobilidad among students, so, there was a sudden interest on international collaboration, among students in particular. Not much scholars, because scholars have also want this, but they are so busy teaching and working, and doing all of that. "
"ID32","Undergraduate Programs",7,53,"Student Programs","social science",1,"F",1,"border state",1,"So for an american university, and I think for mexican university also, the student international exposure is the most powerful, because this is the core of institution.

Right now, for instance, I am going to start teaching at a SDSU class in University Baja California in Mexico, crossing the border every Wednesday. We will cross the border once a week. 
All my student from the United States are going to sit down in classrooms at the University of Baja California, and I will be teaching over there to both my SDSU students and mexican students in the same classroom. 
So, this is something that starts, oh my god, maybe  eight years ago. And the professors, of course, are also going to be crossing the border. This time I am doing it, I am not the only one doing it. There are other professors. This is part of the study abroad course requirements. "

And one of those was a kind of international exposure. SDSU, I think it was in 1999 or 2000, had a provost who herself had studied abroad exposure when she was doing her PhD.  so being the provost of SDSU, so close to the border, we are less than 20 miles away from the border, 20 miles from the border, she was very open to require from major, that for instance, in international studies, that in Latin American studies, chicano studies, some study abroad program requirements. 
And they opened many study abroad programs. Chile for instance, is one of those countries, France, Checoslovaquia, but not all students can travel, because they have family obligations, work obligations. So, to make it easier for them, they establish a relationship just across the border, so there will have to travel twice a week, rather traveling for six months in total."

Because I am not the only one who have initiated this type of collaboration. Colegio de La Frontera Norte has very interested collaboration, because of the nature of the institution and the people working over there. We have geographers, we have sociologists, economists, all of them or the majority have been exposed to those areas, coming from other places from Mexico and other countries. There are many spanish, french working over there. We have colombians, cuban working over there. So, it is a very international institution.

Inter-institutional collaboration cannot exist without personal interests of scholars, but many personal collaborations die after few years because of the lack of support of the institutions, and not because they [institutions] say no, but because of lack of resources, obstacles in terms of time, because international collaboration requires a lot of time. These days, with internet, skypeÖ we did not have emails when we started this international collaboration, these have facilitated to strengthen international collaboration and survive longer the collaboration without having all of these resources. 
But as sooner or later, these faculty members will start to give up and start to become less and less motivated about international collaboration.

So, the language makes a big difference, Ok.  But also the social class report that make them to be more prompt to these collaboration and take the danger to doing it, the international exposure. I would say that there are some social class selectivity in this case, in the  Mexican institutions, but there are really very social class selectivity"

Definitely know creating academic knowledge can also be about how can we bring something to our community, how can we give something back, so I can have that kind of broad idea of what collaboration means.  "
"ID39","Collaboration Examples",11,27,"Definition of Collaboration","education",0,"F",1,"not border state",0," For example, people that I have worked with in the past and that we are working on projects together, publications together, that kind of thing. Oddly enough, one of my most recent collaborators has been my sister who is a professor in Mexico and she is in a completely different field, she is in environmental sciences, but we did know that we had kind of shared experiences when I was teaching in Mexico, about infringement on caution.

"ID39","Collaboration Examples",11,27,"Definition of Collaboration","education",0,"F",1,"not border state",0,"I can make freedom and how that is layout in Mexico, so we wrote an article last year about what that looks like you know and that is something that I never expected because we don’t work on the same things, but that was really exciting to me, other people that are collaborating with me right now are my former advisers from my doctorate, from masters and this is in terms of research, there is also things I’m collaborating in terms of service. For example, the service that I do for CIHE and I know that it is not usually considered within the narrow definition of collaboration but I just cannot separate it, is work that you do together, work that starts as a service and may leave down the road to work that you do as a researchers, co-authors. So for me is very hard to make that clear cut division between what is service to the profession, service to the community, or when it becomes a more research or other kind of collaboration if that makes sense.

"ID39","Collaboration Examples",11,27,"Definition of Collaboration","education",0,"F",1,"not border state",0,"But working as a collaboration you know, you have to take other people’s time lines and life circumstances, and all these things to take into consideration, but even though it can be challenging, I do think it really enriches the project, because you have more people looking at the same data or thinking differently about things that haven’t occurred to you, and again extending that notion of collaboration I see the work that I do with my doctoral students as a collaboration with early career scholars even though that might been seen as well you are training students, well no, I am collaborating with experts in the field, they have extensive experience in students affairs and in things that I don’t have that you know face to face experience, but they do, and so when we are working on a research they come with ideas that I have never expected to think about that so we can follow those so I found that very rewarding, so there is an aspect of collaborative research that is more rewarding than individual research.

We don’t really have higher education as a field at the undergraduate level, so I think that is fairly common and so the field that I was in before, was more related to EFL, translation and literature the overlap of those three areas, so for the longest time I was very much in touch with the faculty there, because I had been an adjunct in that same program and so it transpired when I went to do my PhD that this program that was running at the time in Mexico, PROMED Programa del Mejoramiento del Profesorado."

And that side of the coin made me be on the tenure track. So if there has been an opportunity to have a more you know an actual collaborative project, it would probably had fallen on me and I’m not there right now and like I don’t have the resources or the time available to put into a project that is much easier for me to put it here you know. So I think it was kind of like a perfect storm of things, we might be able to collaborate in the future but because those two things were happening it just made it very difficult.

It’s just very very uncomfortable in because in some way I feel that I have to justify why I am still here when the political climate is so anti-immigrant, so anti-mexican in particular, and at the same time respecting that their decision well, I cannot be part of this community right now because I can’t go against my conscious and train this country that is been so hostile and xenophobic and all kind of madness, so that complicates things for sure.

But then we see a difference in the field of study right? CIES is more open to international and comparative education, is not just higher education you know but there is that willingness to consider there are other systems in the world, and it doesn’t have to be about the US and I always found ASH  to be very US centered, so that willingness is not necessary there, in the same level that might it  be at a conference that has just a bordered a natural international fit, and think that is just you know, I think is many things, but one of them is just short sidedness, that you know we need to talk to each other."

Is not not anything wrong with that is just the structural constrain of needing to polish-polish-polish runs contrary to that, runs contrary to the development of long terms sustainable, on-going, collaborations with people who are not basically close to you, and who might have very different needs and priorities based on what higher education looks like for them, and for them is incredible teaching book.

So, somehow of clearing house or faculty coming together it would be very useful; otherwise, it’s pretty much you as an individual reaching out to people and seeing if they have the time to talk to you and some do, and in that sense you know, that’s also again a researcher to make those connections, is just that all of these takes time, and that’s the, it’s not even about money, I don’t think, you can make always things work, but it’s the time constrain on both sides I think a real barrier and it also matters that you know like I mentioned, the faculty that I have are teaching a lot, that is not necessarily the case for people who are in more elite positions in Mexican universities, like those who belong to SNIT (Sistema Nacional de Investigadores) who may have more course releases, you know, they don’t need to be teaching as much, maybe they are part of research centers, that’s what they do, so in that sense collaboration ends up having this bias, in that you its far easier to establish collaborations with people who are in those centers of power, rather than the research that I am interested in, which has to do with where I come from because that’s what matters to me, you know and this was a regional institution, not prestigious, but those are the topics that interest me, what is happening at that institution, and I know that can be considered as kind of short-sided but I think we need more research that speaks to local context at the same time, not just aggregate data at the national level.

In the US you don’t have that, unless you are driving, and you go from here to Kansas, or go from California to Portland, or if you flight which gets expensive, you have to it several times to collect twenty interviews, and so we had to do a lot of translation on that sense. For example, the fact that they did most of the interview face to face and they did it through Skype, because that was more available. The other thing was different expectations in the terms of the IRB, in the fact that in the US IRB is very concrete, here are the things that you need to do, and many institutions and whole systems don’t have that yet or it works differently, it depends on the researcher.

Is more in the sense of creating connections, rather than the actual labor on doing the research, we tend to get too caught up on the I don’t have money to do that, but you have hands, eyes, ears, and there are always students who are interested in learning about research, so they are getting something out of it too, is not about establishing this exploitative relationship, is about what do you need to learn, and here are some opportunities to learning it.

It just makes things so so complicated for faculty in Mexico at a purely structural level, it has nothing to do with their capacity, and their talent and their ability to do things, is just that when you are teaching four classes and you are trying to create the literature of all on the side and you can’t access papers, literature in your field, you know that’s just a completely different role for me, I knew it, I know what it is like, I’ve done it.

I had to cross a border to have access to staff that was published in my country, because there was no connection of it locally, so that’s the level we are talking about so I really appreciate the level of programs like Promed, in the sense that they want to invest more in the socialization of faculty into doing research, but once they do that, you have to support them in the next stage and the fact is that research is very expensive because it takes time, far more than what it takes to teach a class. So, I think there’s been a, so I think Promed has been very visionary but at the same time I think it has been very short-sided in the expectation that oh you just need to know how to do research and everything else would take care of itself and it’s not true you know.

Well that’s neat, that’s very cute, but that’s not a publication, you see what I mean, so that speaks more to the logic and culture of academia that privileges research collaboration very strictly speaking, a very narrow definition of research, rather than you know, collaboration that may involve teaching, service, communities, and in that case if there was that willingness to broaden our notion of what can look like, immigration, transnationalism, human geography, all of these things suddenly become open to us to come together interdisciplinary, to work on a common topic, and I haven’t seen that.

Hector:
The main problem we discovered is that the mothers of victims who were in the majority poor people without education, in the beginning were represented by the NGOs. So the NGOs were like they had something like a colonial relationship with them. For example, they didn't allow the mothers to talk by themselves. But they gave them the speech they should read in meetings like the UN or other kind of places like that.

Hector:
So, seeing that, we starting to work with them in terms of giving them tools to live autonomous, auto objective, and doing things by themselves. And so we helped to organize them and left them doing the agenda in the way they consider, trying to respect their independence. This was our relationship with the communities we worked.

That is for me kind of very conservative even. When I see people very disciplinary, when I see there is somebody who is not really very concerned about the social problems, this is my view.

Because our schools are more social oriented. There is the revolution, don't forget that.
Hector:

Hector:
And I think the US politics or the federal US politics in the present is not favorable to migration. And it makes very hard to get a humanitarian agreement on this issue. So, providing this context, this situation, the universities are more focalized in these issues. I want to remember ... I think there are more than 10 years that our Latin Americans status program constantly is supporting conferences, workshops, all kind of events related with migration, with violence, with criminal organizations.

Adam:
Right.
Hector:
But we have to improvise a lot. A lot of research has to do improvisation because we are discovering things we didn't know that happened. For example, why we decided that we needed psychologists in our group of research? Because we started to see problems of trauma, anxiety, a lot of depression, and a lot of behavioral issues that relatives of victims were enduring. And if we had a goal to empower them in order for them to be activists and be people who work in the solution of their problem by themselves, we needed first of all to work with their psychological problem.
Hector:
So we invited a group of psychologists to be collaborators in this. We didn't have this before we met the people. We didn't think it was important to have psychologists in our group. But when we saw the problem, we had to look for the solutions and to look for those specialists that can help us."

Yes, so basically after my PhD and post-doc, I began working in Brazil in 2006 I guessed, I always focuses on the atmospheric sciences particularly atmosphere convection and thermodynamic. I also worked with gps monalogy. I was in a research institute in a university in Brazil in the Amazon, physically more than four years but Iíve been working with Brazilians since 2006. And 2012 I took a faculty position in Mexico at the National Autonomous University continue along the same line of research. However, really developing a physical space in Northwest of Mexico and Southwest of the United States in what they called monsoon, the North America monsoon. And that have a been a big focus of my research in the last seven years even though I still continue to collaborating with people from Brazil and this summer we have a collaborative project in with Costa Rica and Columbia and that is major NAS funded scientific campaign, meteorology atmospheric science again. I am on sabbatical this year but Iím still participate in that project from UNAN. and I really have the strong international collaboration right now between my colleagues at the University of Arizona and colleagues in northwest Mexico and my institution in Mexico, it also spread out to other institutions in the US like Rutgers, University of Washington. I worked with people in Noah and Ncar (not sure whatís that 5:15) those are atmosphere science organizations. So itís pretty board geographically but more recently have being here in Mexico and the US other than the recent project in Costa Rica.

David	I have a lot of problem getting people in Mexico interested.

I was inviting to be faculty direct thesis and teaching in addition to the research. It was principally research but I would teach one class a semester. So I have Brazilian students teaching and then I have my own students too. In Mexico it was the same situation although I have many more students and I only teach one class a year in my institution so it was much more focus on my research. I did teach in both places. I also taught short term courses, short courses. I also brought people from the US to teach short courses in my institution in Mexico. So I have done that quite a bit. Iím probably have done that more than anybody else in my center, also the people in the US my colleagues tend to be very willing and interested in going to Mexico so thatís a plus.

"ID2","Institutional Context",6,38,"Institutional Context","science and engineering",1,"M",0,"not border state",0,"In the US side, again I think the structure is okay but the university I think in the last couple of decades has taken on the business model which the universities are not really design to be profit generating machines, there are investment in the future so I think that counting mentality in the fact that for example so many researchers in the US are soft money they have to make a little bit of work to pay their own salary basically given funding so I think thatís very counterproductive too for science because youíre not allow to have the time to sit and think about things youíre worry about your health care and salary. In Mexico, you donít have to worry about that, everything is pay for as a full-time researcher everything is covered in that respect.

One that was particularly important over the years for me was with the University of Arizona, that was associated with the women reproductive healthÖ because I am a demographer and sociologist, so everything that has to do with family, including reproduction and consequently, women health, and dimension and gender. We developed a consortium between USA and Mexican institutes. There were three mexican institutions  and two USA universities. University of Arizona, and USD university, and in the Mexican side, [there were] the Colegio La Frontera Norte, El Colegio de la Frontera Sur  en Chiapas, el Colegio de Sodona.  So that was one.

As you know as an institution, at least the major focus of my university is education. Research is required but it is not necessarily  the main purpose. El Colegio La Frontera de Mexico is exactly the opposite. That was the other factor why I stopped pursuing that [my attempt to pursuing collaboration in Spain and Morroco].
Now, Mexico and Spain, I did not care much about that.  Because there are multiple mexican scholars working on that direction.  
So I was more into these transborder collaboration, geographic units that facilitated the mobility between ordinary individuals."

And I discovered through that project,  that bring together  American universities was not that easy, , because they see each other as competing.

Obviously, you need their support, becase you have  many levels of possible interactions. What is most important is when you have ordinary faculty that were  interested in collaboration because they are the ones who will start moving the pieces, doing the research, talking to people, looking for funds. But they  need to persuade administrators from the department chair, the dean, the provost, etc. And that works in both countries, and you would say in any country. 
So, sometimes the administrators, they are always thinking about money. They are always thinking about what they will get from this collaboration. They are very supportive with the faculty, but when they really see an opportunity to bring something to their own collaboration, but always becomes money, they give you the full support. They will never say no, but then, you do not see any kind of concrete support. 
I think this is the challenge, the most important challenge for any american or mexican scholar or any other ordinary faculty interested in the collaboration.

At the end how I read the statement and the letter I said well probably they are thinking more about institutional relationships, which is what the book chapter that I sent you covers."

Well is that institutional or does it focus on individual faculty? Working with another institution so that one of tis grad students co-authors a paper with me and she presents it a conference in Europe. Well on one respect that’s individual, on another respect, its working with an individual. That’s why I say there’s an enormous array and variations of configurations here. "

There were some programs abroad, but they tended to be through other state universities, and nobody paid much attention to it. I started doing these programs short-term programs in Mexico and largely invented what I was doing. Now, there is an entire monograph that tells us what, when and how it has to be done, and in the entire academic program is secondary to compliance with an extensive set of bureaucratic requirements. Now I teach bureaucracy I understand this, and I understand the university more than anything else is concerned about managing risk. But the way it manages risk creates incredible impediments to doing programs simply because it adds significantly to the cost. It requires programming so far in advance that we lose the opportunity to take advantage of the very opportunities that experiences can create. So what has happened over time, and I can tell you all kinds of stories but I will not because it will upset my institution, but what has happened over time is the bureaucratic framework has to a large degree frozen and marginalized the academic opportunity, and it’s really unfortunate, but that’s a decision made by people at a higher salary grade, and although I live with it a certain aspect and try to deal with in the margins as I can but for example, we are expected now to work through service providers, essentially companies or institutions that sell these services for logistics, organizations, etc. I have all of that in place. It’s simply an additional financial burden on our students, and that it turn, excludes some students from being able to participate, but my institution is less concerned about that then making sure that it has a formal structure they can point to and say that’s our provider. So, that’s the way the institution wants to do it.

There are people interested in our project at this moment, it has just been conversations the university of name (15:21)  in joining our program and they have sent some students to be trained to understand provided by international faculty that we have brought to the program  like another one from Italy and another from Spain who deals with inclusion and accessibility but I would say there are other political reasons that prevent them to exclude their interests but other political factors that they are not helping in making the initial interest. The national university of Mexico, which is the number one university is also very interested and we have signed an agreement with them and actually our first cohort were there for the last semester learning some ways to teach literacy like semantics because we wanted those students to have those social cultural approach to literacy but a more broad understanding of ways of where they are standing while making those decisions as professionals and the national university provided faculty to organize the courses, they organize the courses, I would say the customize them for us, thus they made it open for other professionals who would be interested in taking these courses and I did a interview in December to see how it went and they were very happy and they want to continue to collaborate with us and they said that our students also bring the other area of literacy. There is also different areas that they have been working with, there is sociocultural programs for literacy that I brought to the University of Guajajara, the only one in the country. So there is a lot of curiosity around how we work and what we teach and what are the results, so  we are writing a group showing our results that is going to be published in the fall and we have linked smaller pieces and making many presentations in conferences but most of them donít create the proceedings so that is work to be done to having a presence in the literature.
